        <h2>Foundlings</h2>
        
        <p>The night is dark<br>
        and there is nothing in the sky.</p>
        
        <p>There is a cold in the heights.<br>
        A frozen tarn<br>
        lays impassive on the peak<br>
        and a brutal wind does sweep<br>
        across the meadows,<br>
        crackling among the broken snow.</p>
        
        <p>Flames shiver in a ring of stone<br>
        and a foundling trembles<br>
        in a quaking dance,<br>
        hearkening to the freezing chant<br>
        of the night's syllables of snow<br>
        that not so much resemble<br>
        as suggest the clouds<br>
        smeared across the blue tableau<br>
        some hours ago<br>
        before he reached out and stole<br>
        those sparks from the night,<br>
        before the stars grew unwilling,<br>
        when he could still see<br>
        those pale inkblots in the sky.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Hobbyhorse</h2>
        
        <p>Scrawled<br>
        upon the dust,<br>
        in the dead hand<br>
        of a broken toy,<br>
        the messages stand.</p>
        
        <p>Sprawled,<br>
        splintered and disjoined,<br>
        disassembled they creak,<br>
        sawing the floor beneath.<br>
        They speak<br>
        of a drought in the garden<br>
        and a grinding of teeth.</p>
        
        <p>The salt of the sea<br>
        has risen and fallen,<br>
        burning out in the sun,<br>
        sweeping past<br>
        where a river did run,<br>
        where cowboys are riding fast,<br>
        firing their wooden guns.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Crossing</h2>
        
        <p>The sky's net of stars<br>
        is cast across the night<br>
        into a thirsty sea of eyes.<br>
        The bars<br>
        of light slide<br>
        through the dark<br>
        as the wind rattles<br>
        a closing note.</p>
        
        <p>The sun shatters<br>
        in the sea's engulfing throat,<br>
        the result<br>
        of unstoppable decline.</p>
        
        <p>The sea's lumbering strides<br>
        propel it to the mark<br>
        and it lifts a stealthy hand<br>
        to scribble in a cursive pen<br>
        on the disappearing land.</p>
        
        <p>The distance<br>
        between coasts<br>
        grows thin.</p>
        
        <p>Foaming ghosts<br>
        breach the ocean.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Cage's Lost Symphony</h2>
        
        <p>A mumble<br>
        rolls through a blank room,<br>
        steeped in the wine that<br>
        sloshes in glass wounds,<br>
        and from the rubble<br>
        of a mouth<br>
        a light laugh<br>
        erupts.</p>
        
        <p>The sky holds a smoking gun<br>
        and a fog grips the fence,<br>
        its fingers twisted around<br>
        the chain's metal throat<br>
        in a rattling ascent.<br>
        Drops of rust fleck the street<br>
        and a machine<br>
        screeches its final note.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Unearthed</h2>
        
        <p>A beam flails about<br>
        in the dark.<br>
        A stark<br>
        and empty scene<br>
        of earth and timber<br>
        surrounds<br>
        him.  He sees<br>
        the theater's<br>
        barren stage<br>
        upon which this drama will rage<br>
        and he laughs,<br>
        choking on the dust<br>
        of a thousand magic tricks,<br>
        a thousand illusions,<br>
        a thousand dreams<br>
        of something beyond this place<br>
        whose tiny walls<br>
        have left their mark on his face.</p>
        
        <p>He lets loose one<br>
        echoing call<br>
        and hears his audience scream<br>
        as he taps<br>
        his wooden stick.</p>
        
        <p>The rust<br>
        of unending nights<br>
        explodes with a crack<br>
        and somewhere a clap<br>
        resounds beyond the sweeping light.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Tenders of the Garden</h2>
        
        <p>Roses explode in the storm<br>
        as the wind whips<br>
        the bloodless garden<br>
        into a hazard of thorns.</p>
        
        <p>Gray clouds fulminate,<br>
        convulsing the sky,<br>
        winds flailing<br>
        as the skin is ripped.</p>
        
        <p>Lightning veins the night,<br>
        throbbing in darkness,<br>
        as the rain pulses.<br>
        Its falling seeds germinate<br>
        in the wailing<br>
        of the wind.</p>
        
        <p>Slipping on the wet stone,<br>
        they cut through the brush,<br>
        seeking a feeble shelter.</p>
        
        <p>From behind the hedgerow<br>
        the moon chances a look<br>
        and the night trembles.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Spindrift</h2>
        
        <p>The moon falls<br>
        like a silver hook,<br>
        sinking through the night,<br>
        exploding on the surface<br>
        and falling back<br>
        in limp strings of light.</p>
        
        <p>A line is carelessly cast<br>
        in the sea's blue scrawl.<br>
        The tool bends its gentle crook<br>
        and turns its<br>
        eye upon itself.</p>
        
        <p>The vessel groans and shifts,<br>
        restless in the waves,<br>
        as the line is sent,<br>
        grasping, into the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Far below something awaits<br>
        and the line jumps with a start.<br>
        The sea whitens<br>
        in the moon's mad grip<br>
        and a man shivers on his boat.<br>
        The sea's grip tightens<br>
        and he disappears down its throat.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Beginning of Night</h2>
        
        <p>Words are throbbing in the light.<br>
        Grinding gears are shaking,<br>
        rattling in the wind.<br>
        They're humming the lines<br>
        the keys are playing<br>
        as they chatter<br>
        in the cold.</p>
        
        <p>Fog is billowing<br>
        as the light changes<br>
        and the fool dances<br>
        before his mic.</p>
        
        <p>The light shatters<br>
        in its strobing,<br>
        the bits<br>
        falling in the crowd.<br>
        In the front row<br>
        a zealot rages,<br>
        grasping after the damaged<br>
        and twisted lights,<br>
        while, from the stage,<br>
        a laughter sounds<br>
        at this ending of days.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Turning of Keys</h2>
        
        <p>Bars of light are sliding<br>
        through the trees.<br>
        Leaves are rippling<br>
        on the branch<br>
        like the turning of keys.</p>
        
        <p>A car is writing<br>
        a tale of roads<br>
        in long, lazy curves.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn bursts like a match,<br>
        sets the trees smoldering,<br>
        ash falling as the leaves burn.<br>
        The wind blows<br>
        a few puffs of smoke<br>
        into the last bit of sky.</p>
        
        <p>A candle is sitting,<br>
        flickering,<br>
        in an orange sun,<br>
        smiling at the streets below.</p>
        
        <p>The moon rides into the night.<br>
        You can almost hear those engines hum.</p>
        <br>



        <h2>Broken</h2>
        
        <p>Clouds bubbled in the sky<br>
        as sunlight poured down<br>
        into the clear day.</p>
        
        <p>Light laughter<br>
        like glasses arose<br>
        as teeth clinked.</p>
        
        <p>In the sunlight<br>
        eyes rapidly blinked,<br>
        devouring the glare.</p>
        
        <p>The weird play<br>
        of dancing trash<br>
        stumbled down the road<br>
        in a gust of air.</p>
        
        <p>A face shattered,<br>
        wide open,<br>
        with a crack<br>
        and any bonds or vows<br>
        were neatly broken.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Turning On</h2>
        
        <p>The earth turns<br>
        its eye to the sun<br>
        as it spins its way<br>
        through the night.</p>
        
        <p>A dervish's trail<br>
        unfurls<br>
        in sandy lines<br>
        and candles wink<br>
        at the sight.</p>
        
        <p>A puff<br>
        of dust whirls<br>
        through the temple<br>
        of the night<br>
        and settles<br>
        in blinking signs<br>
        and eyefuls of sleep.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ex Nihilo</h2>
        
        <p>From the dark abyss<br>
        a line<br>
        of light<br>
        erupts.<br>
        In the simple<br>
        hunger of emptiness<br>
        it grows serpentine,<br>
        bending itself,<br>
        coiling,<br>
        the glint<br>
        of stars<br>
        exploding on its back.</p>
        
        <p>A spring lunges,<br>
        dark earth bursting apart<br>
        as it swells.</p>
        
        <p>The needless<br>
        blossom is cracked.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Patient Sky</h2>
        
        <p>The flower opens its eye,<br>
        lids unfurling,<br>
        and the fruit of the earth<br>
        drips onto the soil.</p>
        
        <p>The liberation of decay<br>
        disintegrates its rind,<br>
        like great towers turning<br>
        to sand in the unending surge<br>
        of the patient sky,<br>
        with the thankless toil<br>
        and unceasing work<br>
        of bitter days.</p>
        
        <p>The nights are growing festive<br>
        and the winter's flurries deep.</p>
        
        <p>Ships are growing restless<br>
        as they bob in the distilling seas.</p>
        
        <p>The winds are taken to screaming...<br>
        and to the sowing of seeds.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Passing Through</h2>
        
        <p>The night<br>
        swings its bat<br>
        at an orange sun<br>
        and it shatters<br>
        into twilight.<br>
        Seeds of light<br>
        are scattered<br>
        across the sky<br>
        as the darkness runs.</p>
        
        <p>Behind its mask<br>
        a ghost pursues<br>
        the night<br>
        as the winds<br>
        pass through<br>
        the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Torn from their husk<br>
        the stars fly free,<br>
        hurtling through space.</p>
        
        <p>The ghost caresses its new face<br>
        and, though by night winds unmoved,<br>
        the garb<br>
        it wears is unwinding<br>
        like the fading of the mist<br>
        in the risen sun.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Quiet Song</h2>
        
        <p>The sky waves<br>
        its banner,<br>
        it whips in the wind,<br>
        and light rain<br>
        sounds a march<br>
        across the damp earth.</p>
        
        <p>With a spark<br>
        the storm's rapid fuse<br>
        is ablaze.<br>
        The daylight explodes<br>
        with a crash,<br>
        metal contorting<br>
        through the sky.</p>
        
        <p>In the haze<br>
        twisted wreckage looms<br>
        and settles<br>
        in a slow collapse.</p>
        
        <p>The storm seems<br>
        to give up,<br>
        loosen its tight grasp<br>
        on the rain<br>
        and the light.<br>
        The sound of its drums<br>
        has run thin.</p>
        
        <p>A white flag<br>
        ripples in the sky<br>
        and is gone<br>
        leaving just the wind<br>
        blowing through<br>
        the clear blue<br>
        with its quiet song.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Lasting But a Moment...</h2>
        
        <p>The sun has fallen<br>
        and the day's funeral<br>
        has begun,<br>
        lowering its coffin<br>
        into the earth. The<br>
        sky grows dark<br>
        with mourning.</p>
        
        <p>Wine sloshes into place<br>
        before the glasses have risen<br>
        in their toasting,<br>
        flashing with dull sparks<br>
        in the flickering light.</p>
        
        <p>The crickets are singing<br>
        in the tittering night<br>
        and the stars do shake<br>
        with laughter.</p>
        
        <p>Lights are winking<br>
        in the hereafter.</p>

        <h2>The Mapmaker</h2>
        
        <p>The sky writes<br>
        a cryptic scrawl<br>
        across the erg<br>
        in crescents of sand&mdash;<br>
        a cypher to peruse<br>
        found in the sickle<br>
        of the wind<br>
        and the remains<br>
        it leaves behind.</p>
        
        <p>Like an iceberg<br>
        adrift on the deep<br>
        a ruin floats on grains<br>
        of dirt tossed about<br>
        by mercurial, fickle<br>
        winds in this arid land&mdash;<br>
        an abandoned keep<br>
        surrendered to the sky<br>
        in a sandy fall.</p>
        
        <p>Dusty soldiers are lined<br>
        up on the stony front<br>
        as the sky fights<br>
        with its forces pinned<br>
        against a broken redoubt.</p>
        
        <p>A squawk comes over the cable<br>
        inspiring a ruthless hunt<br>
        as the general turns his eye<br>
        to the maps on his table<br>
        in search of further clues.</p>

        The stars tremble<br>
        in a dying of the light.</p>
        
        <p>Pale spiders skitter<br>
        across the skin of the night<br>
        before the first blush of dawn.<br>
        The jaundiced sky withers<br>
        at its bleeding horizon.</p>
        
        <p>A song<br>
        rises inside the temple<br>
        from the mouth<br>
        of an eclipsed sun<br>
        and resounds<br>
        in the bright crash<br>
        of an echoing<br>
        gong.</p>
        
        <p>A tamed lion's<br>
        roaring<br>

        tracing the body of the sky,<br>
        but cannot staunch<br>
        the surging dawn.</p>
        
        <p>The stain<br>
        of light<br>
        spreads<br>
        but the<br>
        stars die<br>
        slowly.</p>
        
        <p>The earth is placed<br>
        in a frame<br>
        of parched skies.</p>
        
        <p>The shadowy tread<br>
        of night<br>
        steps on bones,<br>
        with the boots<br>
        of the<br>
        wondering mob.</p>
        
        <p>The lost cogs<br>
        of a creaking<br>
        subterfuge<br>
        are rolling<br>
        across the sky<br>
        and its face<br>
        is bleeding.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Guest</h2>
        
        <p>Crouching in its<br>
        disheveled yard,<br>
        it bows to the wind,<br>
        murmuring an obsequity<br>
        in creaking timber.</p>
        
        <p>Wrinkles of<br>
        failing paint<br>
        marble its skin,<br>
        and fall apart:<br>
        a trickling<br>
        of stars,<br>
        as constellations<br>
        undo themselves.</p>
        
        <p>Bricks pulled from<br>
        the foundation<br>
        lie beneath windows<br>
        that wait to be broken.<br>
        Wielding its bones,<br>
        a vandal will deface<br>
        the fragile skin,<br>
        now that it's thinner.</p>
        
        <p>Its door swings open<br>
        in a polite gesture<br>
        of invitation<br>
        to the weather.</p>
        
        <p>The rope lies broken<br>
        in the forgotten well.</p>

        <h2>The Sun Is Setting</h2>
        
        <p>Birds squawk<br>
        in a jagged dance<br>
        of sharpened angles<br>
        in a fog-filled marsh,<br>
        cloudy forms writhing<br>
        in a vague discourse.</p>
        
        <p>The sewers whisper<br>
        to the streets<br>
        in a breath of steam<br>
        where the modern talk<br>
        of the kidnapped<br>
        is enslaved to vandals<br>
        in a scrawl of the dying.</p>
        
        <p>This litter,<br>
        this hard<br>
        rain of confetti,<br>
        it forever falls<br>
        when the sun is setting.</p>

        <br>        
        <h2>Dimly Remembered</h2>
        
        <p>A shattered green vine<br>
        spilling its wine.<br>
        I eat the shards,<br>
        use them to cut out my heart.</p>
        
        <p>I hold it aloft before the gods.<br>
        It beats its wings like a dove.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Sound Like Sleep</h2>
        
        <p>The wind shakes the trees in sobbing gusts.<br>
        The starlight shatters into falling dust.<br>
        A sound like a sleeper shifting in bed<br>
        rises.  This thread<br>
        unravels.</p>
        
        <p>An untangled web is loosed and travels,<br>
        skittering over the concrete,<br>
        sweeping once lost streets<br>
        until they're emptied.</p>
        
        <p>Dead seeds<br>
        awaken and burst.<br>
        A mad thirst<br>
        trembles in the throat<br>
        that only knows this one note,<br>
        singing its malison.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe I'll sing along, just this once.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Angle</h2>
        
        <p>So casual in that red leather chair,<br>
        the smoke scatters with a tortured air<br>
        as he taps his cigar,<br>
        the ash falls like a thick scar<br>
        sliding from a glowing wound.</p>
        
        <p>A stillness in this seething room...<br>
        He makes a gesture, a ripple of his hand.<br>
        What to make of this man?</p>
        
        <p>Something collapses beyond the wall.</p>
        
        <p>I can feel the crawl<br>
        of my hands as they spider<br>
        along the wood.  Tighter<br>
        and tighter, they strangle<br>
        the place I sit.  An angle</p>
        
        <p>I throw between us<br>
        could be what<br>
        saves me in the end<br>
        but where will I be then?</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Fall</h2>
        
        <p>Something was aflutter,<br>
        wings beaten by the gutter,<br>
        crumpled and thrown away.</p>
        
        <p>I saw you flailing in the wind one day,<br>
        whispering when you touched the ground,<br>
        and I thought to myself, what now?</p>
        
        <p>I could barely make you out<br>
        over this new sound<br>
        and you were dirty in your<br>
        tarantella, smudged and impure.</p>
        
        <p>You had sold all that was left<br>
        and you were twisted into a dress<br>
        that was far too small.</p>
        
        <p>Oh, how the mighty do fall.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Celebration</h2>
        
        <p>...that's when they spoke<br>
        of the curse of the temple,<br>
        and of how the obscene<br>
        must lie forever unknown,<br>
        of the law of the kings.</p>
        
        <p>The sun had fallen<br>
        and the workers fled,<br>
        and wordless scribes<br>
        had dropped their pens<br>
        to claw the sand instead.</p>
        
        <p>The night was yellow<br>
        with the unsettled<br>
        dust of this blasphemy<br>
        and the incandescents<br>
        flickered uncertainly.</p>
        
        <p>The day's frail ghost<br>
        shakes all the bones<br>
        that it possesses<br>
        to lose the unforgotten<br>
        in a macabre procession.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Valet Parking</h2>
        
        <p>The valets are massing<br>
        as the night throws cars<br>
        in thin black lines<br>
        of calligrapher's art,<br>
        and they're sighing<br>
        across pages of night.</p>
        
        <p>Like a pendant dancing<br>
        in her decolletage,<br>
        a new suit-and-tie<br>
        swings from her arm,<br>
        his teeth trying<br>
        to catch the light.</p>
        
        <p>Random muses hatching<br>
        from the restaurant<br>
        crack the doors at nine.<br>
        Men signal for their cars<br>
        while valets are busy rifling<br>
        through the contents of the ride.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Hunger</h2>
        
        <p>The cars are slouching<br>
        to the city's jaundiced beat<br>
        of acrylic cuts.</p>
        
        <p>The sweet rose's sound<br>
        accents the wafting tongues<br>
        of billboard preachers.</p>
        
        <p>Here at the crossroads,<br>
        sour apples tempt the shrunken,<br>
        who no longer reach.</p>
        
        <p>The lotus blossom<br>
        flickers open on the screen,<br>
        and it sings of lust.</p>
        
        <p>The sleepwalkers step<br>
        into the mouths of their gowns,<br>
        mumbling bedtime tales.</p>
        
        <p>Here, where the world ends,<br>
        unwounded dragons awake<br>
        the devourer.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Courtship</h2>
        
        <p>He serenades the sky,<br>
        in romantic despair,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        
        <p>When her gray beauty strides<br>
        across the blue barrens,<br>
        he serenades the sky.</p>
        
        <p>He praises her unkindness<br>
        with his songs of swearing,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        
        <p>When she roars with violence<br>
        and her tears are harrowing,<br>
        he serenades the sky.</p>
        
        <p>He watches the storm subside,<br>
        finds himself not caring,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        
        <p>When the winds fall silent,<br>
        he plays a mournful air.<br>
        He serenades the sky,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Drifting Away</h2>
        
        <p>My skin is rended<br>
        by the sun's convulsing light<br>
        as spring comes thrusting<br>
        forth with a rustling cry<br>
        and into my empty limbs.</p>
        
        <p>As summer ascends,<br>
        red flames burn on my branches<br>
        with their drooling tongues<br>
        until they're full on my sap<br>
        and leave in a steady dripping.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn is subtle,<br>
        and I am slowly bereaved<br>
        as it works in stealth,<br>
        leaves drifting off in the breeze<br>
        as they're seduced by the wind.</p>
        
        <p>In long sobbing gusts,<br>
        my naked limbs are shaking<br>
        when winter descends<br>
        its delicate spiral case,<br>
        bringing my last visitor.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>III</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>In the Orchard</h2>
        
        <p>The cold white burn of stars<br>
        flecks the sky like sugar,<br>
        the cold white softness<br>
        soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>The white earth of the grave.</p>
        
        <p>White sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>White snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        by a crystalline brook<br>
        that's laughing over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
         
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing,<br>
        like a scream.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Remnants of Autumn</h2>
        
        <p>Autumn corn of autumn leaves<br>
        in orange and red and yellow.</p>
        
        <p>Vernal leaves drift in the wind<br>
        like white icebergs on the sea.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed, as always, in black,<br>
        I walk through this storm of leaves<br>
        until the soft warm rain subsides<br>
        and I find a clear little waterfall<br>
        formed of crooked silver-grey rock,<br>
        like a moon directing the warm waters.</p>
        
        <p>The moon shines<br>
        over a black stretch of forests<br>
        and snow white as the moon.</p>
        
        <p>The bark is black<br>
        as with a burning<br>
        and caked with snow<br>
        like white gauze.</p>
        
        <p>Burned by the fiery colors of autumn,<br>
        the fields are ablaze with indian corn.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Many Darknesses</h2>
        
        <p>A dark street curves upward<br>
        through the night,<br>
        drenched in loneliness.</p>
        
        <p>Peach-colored streetlamps<br>
        burn alone in the emptiness.</p>
        
        <p>A yellow candle burns<br>
        behind the dark pane<br>
        of a window.</p>
        
        <p>I put my palm to the cool glass<br>
        then rest my head there as if to sleep<br>
        and now I sit with my head resting in my hand,<br>
        weeping, at the brown table<br>
        upon which the candle sits.</p>
        
        <p>A candle burns<br>
        in a red glass<br>
        bloodying a bedroom<br>
        with a doleful light.</p>
        
        <p>I stare at the red sunset on the horizon<br>
        through a sliding glass door<br>
        over the shapes of black-green conifers.</p>
        
        <p>Night falls deep and blue.</p>
        
        <p>A black chandelier<br>
        is dimmed to eerie embers.</p>
        
        <p>Darkness waits in an open door.<br>
        The door slams closed on its own.</p>
        
        <p>An old wooden gate<br>
        swings back and forth<br>
        for no reason.</p>
        
        <p>A pale blue flash of lightning<br>
        reveals a child<br>
        standing in the middle of the night<br>
        clutching a doll.</p>
        
        <p>She has pale skin<br>
        and she stares at me<br>
        with her black irises.</p>
        
        <p>At that moment, everything ends.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Insensate</h2>
        
        <p>An arching black-streaked gate<br>
        protects a solid darkness.</p>
        
        <p>Massive dark tree trunks<br>
        huddle together,<br>
        whispering.</p>
        
        <p>Water drips<br>
        from the stalagtites<br>
        onto dark<br>
        subterranean pools.</p>
        
        <p>Someone stands silhouetted<br>
        in the entrance to the cave.</p>
        
        <p>He's staring at me<br>
        through slits of light.</p>
        
        <p>A torch burns<br>
        in a sconce<br>
        with a crayon fire.</p>
        
        <p>Up ahead the path divides,<br>
        each choice unappealing.</p>
        
        <p>A square of light<br>
        floats through<br>
        an abandoned room.</p>
        
        <p>Gossamer curtains<br>
        move in an unfelt wind.</p>
        
        <p>Insensate.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Cessation</h2>
        
        <p>A blind is closed<br>
        and then opened again.<br>
        The window is a square<br>
        of dark blue.</p>
        
        <p>A wash of light<br>
        courses through<br>
        the night. A comet...</p>
        
        <p>In the dark distance<br>
        a faint light illuminates.</p>
        
        <p>I am looking<br>
        at a snapshot<br>
        of a zen garden<br>
        filled with pebbles.</p>
        
        <p>I am struck<br>
        by the fear<br>
        of memory.<br>
        I can go<br>
        no further.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Away, Into, Away</h2>
        
        <p>In the chill blue air<br>
        a purple flower<br>
        peels itself open,<br>
        stretching until<br>
        its petals fall away.</p>
        
        <p>One of them spirals<br>
        through a vast,<br>
        roaring emptiness<br>
        until it's frozen<br>
        in a block of ice.</p>
        
        <p>A naked woman in a blue room,<br>
        filled with silence and water,<br>
        strides down flooded stairs<br>
        into the cold embrace<br>
        of a freezing pool,<br>
        a small smile floating<br>
        to the surface of her face.</p>
        
        <p>In the burning yellow air,<br>
        a woman closes her book<br>
        and rises to her feet.<br>
        She tosses her book<br>
        into the pool<br>
        as she walks away.<br>
        It goes quietly<br>
        into the water,<br>
        its pages still dry.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Against the Silence</h2>
        
        <p>A gold crown rests<br>
        on a cushion of night.<br>
        A soft whispering<br>
        in the dark.</p>
        
        <p>The wind is gentle<br>
        in the green leaves<br>
        of a murmuring forest.</p>
        
        <p>Coins are falling<br>
        in a quiet rain,<br>
        soaking velvet.</p>
        
        <p>A man moves through<br>
        a faint blue storm,<br>
        hard footsteps<br>
        on cold asphalt.</p>
        
        <p>A car keeps driving<br>
        on through the dark,<br>
        lit by dirty yellow light.<br>
        The tires' low growl<br>
        yelps to a stop.</p>
        
        <p>An empty house,<br>
        its cold panels flat<br>
        against the silence.<br>
        Welcome home.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>It's Time</h2>
        
        <p>The air is cool and still:<br>
        white streaks in blue marble.<br>
        Crickets are singing offstage.</p>
        
        <p>A bush waves in greeting<br>
        with its dusty green hand<br>
        while it whispers something<br>
        in your ear.</p>
        
        <p>A coarse path lies before you,<br>
        graying into the cold distance.<br>
        Your steps are hungry<br>
        and they crunch the miles,<br>
        with the mouth of the garden open.</p>
        
        <p>A burgundy flower is there,<br>
        the thorns daring you<br>
        to pick up the glass,<br>
        to know the taste<br>
        you'll never have.</p>
        
        <p>Sapphire burns in the sky;<br>
        sounds like a shattering,<br>
        tastes like glass: sweet.</p>
        
        <p>Don't you think it's time<br>
        you closed your eyes?</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Erosion</h2>
        
        <p>The clouds are sighing<br>
        and the wind is soaked<br>
        in the storm's flat grey.</p>
        
        <p>The rain stumbles,<br>
        tripping on salted earth,<br>
        collapsing into silt seas.</p>
        
        <p>The waves scribble<br>
        on the blank tides<br>
        with their blue pen<br>
        until the ink runs low.</p>
        
        <p>The ground is erased<br>
        in whispering strokes<br>
        of grey debris.</p>
        
        <p>The world's<br>
        demoralized breath<br>
        shuffles by,<br>
        carting the land away.</p>

        <h2>Ghosts</h2>
        
        <p>In the speckled dark,<br>
        in the airless murk,<br>
        in my starless sight,<br>
        I can see the heat<br>
        of my body burn<br>
        as air is torn<br>
        from nothingness.</p>
        
        <p>I walk a brisk pace<br>
        down nonexistent paths.<br>
        The bones of sloths<br>
        are a white pavement<br>
        which no ghosts haunt<br>
        because there is no past<br>
        to lay them to waste.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Parenthetical</h2>
        
        <p>&mdash;I have never retreated,<br>
        I have only advanced.&mdash;</p>
        
        <p>(A victorious enemy<br>
        marches on my tongue.)</p>
        
        <p>[My own private Vietnam<br>
        in every syllable I sing.]</p>
        
        <p>(I taste mud with every tread<br>
        and every tastebud they gain.)</p>
        
        <p>[Every breath is occupied<br>
        and lies in glowing ruin.]</p>
        
        <p>(Their measured footfalls<br>
        grinding teeth in perfect time.)</p>
        
        <p>[I'm burning syllables<br>
        in order to save them.]</p>
        
        <p>(I can feel the jagged pang<br>
        of enamel beneath their boots.)</p>
        
        <p>[Sibilants are writhing<br>
        in a hiss of bullets.]</p>
        
        <p>(They reach my lips' wet halls,<br>
        soldiers slipping in the pink.)</p>
        
        <p>[A guttural growls<br>
        under a purring tank.]</p>
        
        <p>(I no longer hear the din<br>
        of the mouth they maim.)</p>
        
        <p>[Vowels are held down<br>
        and made to scream.]</p>
        
        <p>&mdash;I have walked so far<br>
        only to surrender.&mdash;</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Red Rock</h2>
        
        <p>A wilted flower crumbles open,<br>
        entreating the beehive to sting,<br>
        to enliven with their dyeing pain<br>
        and with their murmuring song.</p>
        
        <p>It wobbles at every touch,<br>
        in an uncertain dance,<br>
        sighing out of reach<br>
        in the weather's violence.</p>
        
        <p>It moves in a windy dodge,<br>
        with an atmospheric scream.<br>
        Its whipped along the ridge<br>
        and then severed at the stem.</p>
        
        <p>In the arroyo's crimson tear,<br>
        it feathers into the dust.<br>
        It will spring up again later<br>
        when the rains bring their unrest.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Great Reward</h2>
        
        <p>The green leaves of fame<br>
        are cooling on my head.</p>
        
        <p>&mdash;Blood shatters its violent gem<br>
        across a bed someone else made.&mdash;</p>
        
        <p>Glasses ring in icy tribute<br>
        as water condenses on the skin.</p>
        
        <p>&mdash;From disease's dizzying height<br>
        I take in a spinning scene.&mdash;</p>
        
        <p>I drink the sparkling praise<br>
        and my mind starts reeling.</p>
        
        <p>&mdash;Sobbing in sanguine cries,<br>
        my heart beats its ragged song.&mdash;</p>
        
        <p>Glasses weep joyful rivulets<br>
        of condensation upon my hand.</p>
        
        <p>&mdash;My heart reads in painful fits<br>
        the final verse it's underlined.&mdash;</p>
        
        <p>The poem's beautiful refrain<br>
        is a line of trochaic applause.</p>
        
        <p>&mdash;Death scrawls its fevered rune<br>
        in front of my dreaming eyes.&mdash;</p>
        
        <p>My green pen's scribbling rush<br>
        signs one autograph before I dash.</p>

        <h2>Back and Forth</h2>
        
        <p>The dismissive path<br>
        of a fluttering bird<br>
        flickers soundless<br>
        through a cold room.</p>
        
        <p>A dirty thing<br>
        of dull color<br>
        flies north<br>
        passed the guard.</p>
        
        <p>Slowly the geese<br>
        lay their claim,<br>
        with hungry song,<br>
        to the crimson shore,<br>
        where, writhing beneath,<br>
        the ocean wears a scared<br>
        look on its blanching face.</p>
        
        <p>* * *</p>
        
        <p>Back and forth, the fish swim</p>

        <p>on the lines of power.</p>

        <h2>The Tower</h2>
        
        <p>Constellations of broken glass<br>
        cover the floor in dusty light.<br>
        The gaping holes of jagged sky<br>
        they came from offer a broken view<br>
        to the one curled up inside.</p>
        
        <p>A slight chill holds the air<br>
        like a hand of melting ice.</p>
        
        <p>Dirt hovers like a dust mote<br>
        in the artificial dusk<br>
        as it fuzzies up the shadow.</p>
        
        <p>And the speaker will hide<br>
        behind the rotting chair<br>
        as the wind ransacks the place.</p>
        
        <p>The barbarian is at the gate<br>
        and the weather is brisk.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Drought</h2>
        
        <p>The wind is blowing<br>
        through the empty spaces,<br>
        that it alone created,<br>
        with its mournful whisper.</p>
        
        <p>Grains of sand rattle<br>
        on the cold ground.</p>
        
        <p>The air would sting<br>
        with its dirty hues<br>
        but only the dead<br>
        are out at this hour.</p>
        
        <p>When you turn up the dial<br>
        to hear the static grind,<br>
        listen to the land gnawing<br>
        on itself as it confesses,<br>
        in a moment its long dreaded.</p>
        
        <p>Standing atop the spire<br>
        where the wind is brutal,<br>
        as the tower below groaned,<br>
        he waited for the thawing,<br>
        for water to flood his senses.</p>
