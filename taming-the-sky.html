        <h2>In the Orchard</h2>
        
        <p>The cold white burn of stars<br>
        flecks the sky like sugar,<br>
        the cold white softness<br>
        soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>The white earth of the grave.</p>
        
        <p>White sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>White snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        by a crystalline brook<br>
        that's laughing over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
         
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing,<br>
        like a scream.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Remnants of Autumn</h2>
        
        <p>Autumn corn of autumn leaves<br>
        in orange and red and yellow.</p>
        
        <p>Vernal leaves drift in the wind<br>
        like white icebergs on the sea.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed, as always, in black,<br>
        I walk through this storm of leaves<br>
        until the soft warm rain subsides<br>
        and I find a clear little waterfall<br>
        formed of crooked silver-grey rock,<br>
        like a moon directing the warm waters.</p>
        
        <p>The moon shines<br>
        over a black stretch of forests<br>
        and snow white as the moon.</p>
        
        <p>The bark is black<br>
        as with a burning<br>
        and caked with snow<br>
        like white gauze.</p>
        
        <p>Burned by the fiery colors of autumn,<br>
        the fields are ablaze with indian corn.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Many Darknesses</h2>
        
        <p>A dark street curves upward<br>
        through the night,<br>
        drenched in loneliness.</p>
        
        <p>Peach-colored streetlamps<br>
        burn alone in the emptiness.</p>
        
        <p>A yellow candle burns<br>
        behind the dark pane<br>
        of a window.</p>
        
        <p>I put my palm to the cool glass<br>
        then rest my head there as if to sleep<br>
        and now I sit with my head resting in my hand,<br>
        weeping, at the brown table<br>
        upon which the candle sits.</p>
        
        <p>A candle burns<br>
        in a red glass<br>
        bloodying a bedroom<br>
        with a doleful light.</p>
        
        <p>I stare at the red sunset on the horizon<br>
        through a sliding glass door<br>
        over the shapes of black-green conifers.</p>
        
        <p>Night falls deep and blue.</p>
        
        <p>A black chandelier<br>
        is dimmed to eerie embers.</p>
        
        <p>Darkness waits in an open door.<br>
        The door slams closed on its own.</p>
        
        <p>An old wooden gate<br>
        swings back and forth<br>
        for no reason.</p>
        
        <p>A pale blue flash of lightning<br>
        reveals a child<br>
        standing in the middle of the night<br>
        clutching a doll.</p>
        
        <p>She has pale skin<br>
        and she stares at me<br>
        with her black irises.</p>
        
        <p>At that moment, everything ends.</p>
