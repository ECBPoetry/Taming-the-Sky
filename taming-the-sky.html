        <h2>Foundlings</h2>
        
        <p>The night is dark<br>
        and there is nothing in the sky.</p>
        
        <p>There is a cold in the heights.<br>
        A frozen tarn<br>
        lays impassive on the peak<br>
        and a brutal wind does sweep<br>
        across the meadows,<br>
        crackling among the broken snow.</p>
        
        <p>Flames shiver in a ring of stone<br>
        and a foundling trembles<br>
        in a quaking dance,<br>
        hearkening to the freezing chant<br>
        of the night's syllables of snow<br>
        that not so much resemble<br>
        as suggest the clouds<br>
        smeared across the blue tableau<br>
        some hours ago<br>
        before he reached out and stole<br>
        those sparks from the night,<br>
        before the stars grew unwilling,<br>
        when he could still see<br>
        those pale inkblots in the sky.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Hobbyhorse</h2>
        
        <p>Scrawled<br>
        upon the dust,<br>
        in the dead hand<br>
        of a broken toy,<br>
        the messages stand.</p>
        
        <p>Sprawled,<br>
        splintered and disjoined,<br>
        disassembled they creak,<br>
        sawing the floor beneath.<br>
        They speak<br>
        of a drought in the garden<br>
        and a grinding of teeth.</p>
        
        <p>The salt of the sea<br>
        has risen and fallen,<br>
        burning out in the sun,<br>
        sweeping past<br>
        where a river did run,<br>
        where cowboys are riding fast,<br>
        firing their wooden guns.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Crossing</h2>
        
        <p>The sky's net of stars<br>
        is cast across the night<br>
        into a thirsty sea of eyes.<br>
        The bars<br>
        of light slide<br>
        through the dark<br>
        as the wind rattles<br>
        a closing note.</p>
        
        <p>The sun shatters<br>
        in the sea's engulfing throat,<br>
        the result<br>
        of unstoppable decline.</p>
        
        <p>The sea's lumbering strides<br>
        propel it to the mark<br>
        and it lifts a stealthy hand<br>
        to scribble in a cursive pen<br>
        on the disappearing land.</p>
        
        <p>The distance<br>
        between coasts<br>
        grows thin.</p>
        
        <p>Foaming ghosts<br>
        breach the ocean.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Cage's Lost Symphony</h2>
        
        <p>A mumble<br>
        rolls through a blank room,<br>
        steeped in the wine that<br>
        sloshes in glass wounds,<br>
        and from the rubble<br>
        of a mouth<br>
        a light laugh<br>
        erupts.</p>
        
        <p>The sky holds a smoking gun<br>
        and a fog grips the fence,<br>
        its fingers twisted around<br>
        the chain's metal throat<br>
        in a rattling ascent.<br>
        Drops of rust fleck the street<br>
        and a machine<br>
        screeches its final note.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Unearthed</h2>
        
        <p>A beam flails about<br>
        in the dark.<br>
        A stark<br>
        and empty scene<br>
        of earth and timber<br>
        surrounds<br>
        him.  He sees<br>
        the theater's<br>
        barren stage<br>
        upon which this drama will rage<br>
        and he laughs,<br>
        choking on the dust<br>
        of a thousand magic tricks,<br>
        a thousand illusions,<br>
        a thousand dreams<br>
        of something beyond this place<br>
        whose tiny walls<br>
        have left their mark on his face.</p>
        
        <p>He lets loose one<br>
        echoing call<br>
        and hears his audience scream<br>
        as he taps<br>
        his wooden stick.</p>
        
        <p>The rust<br>
        of unending nights<br>
        explodes with a crack<br>
        and somewhere a clap<br>
        resounds beyond the sweeping light.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Tenders of the Garden</h2>
        
        <p>Roses explode in the storm<br>
        as the wind whips<br>
        the bloodless garden<br>
        into a hazard of thorns.</p>
        
        <p>Gray clouds fulminate,<br>
        convulsing the sky,<br>
        winds flailing<br>
        as the skin is ripped.</p>
        
        <p>Lightning veins the night,<br>
        throbbing in darkness,<br>
        as the rain pulses.<br>
        Its falling seeds germinate<br>
        in the wailing<br>
        of the wind.</p>
        
        <p>Slipping on the wet stone,<br>
        they cut through the brush,<br>
        seeking a feeble shelter.</p>
        
        <p>From behind the hedgerow<br>
        the moon chances a look<br>
        and the night trembles.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Spindrift</h2>
        
        <p>The moon falls<br>
        like a silver hook,<br>
        sinking through the night,<br>
        exploding on the surface<br>
        and falling back<br>
        in limp strings of light.</p>
        
        <p>A line is carelessly cast<br>
        in the sea's blue scrawl.<br>
        The tool bends its gentle crook<br>
        and turns its<br>
        eye upon itself.</p>
        
        <p>The vessel groans and shifts,<br>
        restless in the waves,<br>
        as the line is sent,<br>
        grasping, into the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Far below something awaits<br>
        and the line jumps with a start.<br>
        The sea whitens<br>
        in the moon's mad grip<br>
        and a man shivers on his boat.<br>
        The sea's grip tightens<br>
        and he disappears down its throat.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Beginning of Night</h2>
        
        <p>Words are throbbing in the light.<br>
        Grinding gears are shaking,<br>
        rattling in the wind.<br>
        They're humming the lines<br>
        the keys are playing<br>
        as they chatter<br>
        in the cold.</p>
        
        <p>Fog is billowing<br>
        as the light changes<br>
        and the fool dances<br>
        before his mic.</p>
        
        <p>The light shatters<br>
        in its strobing,<br>
        the bits<br>
        falling in the crowd.<br>
        In the front row<br>
        a zealot rages,<br>
        grasping after the damaged<br>
        and twisted lights,<br>
        while, from the stage,<br>
        a laughter sounds<br>
        at this ending of days.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Turning of Keys</h2>
        
        <p>Bars of light are sliding<br>
        through the trees.<br>
        Leaves are rippling<br>
        on the branch<br>
        like the turning of keys.</p>
        
        <p>A car is writing<br>
        a tale of roads<br>
        in long, lazy curves.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn bursts like a match,<br>
        sets the trees smoldering,<br>
        ash falling as the leaves burn.<br>
        The wind blows<br>
        a few puffs of smoke<br>
        into the last bit of sky.</p>
        
        <p>A candle is sitting,<br>
        flickering,<br>
        in an orange sun,<br>
        smiling at the streets below.</p>
        
        <p>The moon rides into the night.<br>
        You can almost hear those engines hum.</p>
        <br>



        <h2>Broken</h2>
        
        <p>Clouds bubbled in the sky<br>
        as sunlight poured down<br>
        into the clear day.</p>
        
        <p>Light laughter<br>
        like glasses arose<br>
        as teeth clinked.</p>
        
        <p>In the sunlight<br>
        eyes rapidly blinked,<br>
        devouring the glare.</p>
        
        <p>The weird play<br>
        of dancing trash<br>
        stumbled down the road<br>
        in a gust of air.</p>
        
        <p>A face shattered,<br>
        wide open,<br>
        with a crack<br>
        and any bonds or vows<br>
        were neatly broken.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Turning On</h2>
        
        <p>The earth turns<br>
        its eye to the sun<br>
        as it spins its way<br>
        through the night.</p>
        
        <p>A dervish's trail<br>
        unfurls<br>
        in sandy lines<br>
        and candles wink<br>
        at the sight.</p>
        
        <p>A puff<br>
        of dust whirls<br>
        through the temple<br>
        of the night<br>
        and settles<br>
        in blinking signs<br>
        and eyefuls of sleep.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ex Nihilo</h2>
        
        <p>From the dark abyss<br>
        a line<br>
        of light<br>
        erupts.<br>
        In the simple<br>
        hunger of emptiness<br>
        it grows serpentine,<br>
        bending itself,<br>
        coiling,<br>
        the glint<br>
        of stars<br>
        exploding on its back.</p>
        
        <p>A spring lunges,<br>
        dark earth bursting apart<br>
        as it swells.</p>
        
        <p>The needless<br>
        blossom is cracked.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Patient Sky</h2>
        
        <p>The flower opens its eye,<br>
        lids unfurling,<br>
        and the fruit of the earth<br>
        drips onto the soil.</p>
        
        <p>The liberation of decay<br>
        disintegrates its rind,<br>
        like great towers turning<br>
        to sand in the unending surge<br>
        of the patient sky,<br>
        with the thankless toil<br>
        and unceasing work<br>
        of bitter days.</p>
        
        <p>The nights are growing festive<br>
        and the winter's flurries deep.</p>
        
        <p>Ships are growing restless<br>
        as they bob in the distilling seas.</p>
        
        <p>The winds are taken to screaming...<br>
        and to the sowing of seeds.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Passing Through</h2>
        
        <p>The night<br>
        swings its bat<br>
        at an orange sun<br>
        and it shatters<br>
        into twilight.<br>
        Seeds of light<br>
        are scattered<br>
        across the sky<br>
        as the darkness runs.</p>
        
        <p>Behind its mask<br>
        a ghost pursues<br>
        the night<br>
        as the winds<br>
        pass through<br>
        the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Torn from their husk<br>
        the stars fly free,<br>
        hurtling through space.</p>
        
        <p>The ghost caresses its new face<br>
        and, though by night winds unmoved,<br>
        the garb<br>
        it wears is unwinding<br>
        like the fading of the mist<br>
        in the risen sun.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Quiet Song</h2>
        
        <p>The sky waves<br>
        its banner,<br>
        it whips in the wind,<br>
        and light rain<br>
        sounds a march<br>
        across the damp earth.</p>
        
        <p>With a spark<br>
        the storm's rapid fuse<br>
        is ablaze.<br>
        The daylight explodes<br>
        with a crash,<br>
        metal contorting<br>
        through the sky.</p>
        
        <p>In the haze<br>
        twisted wreckage looms<br>
        and settles<br>
        in a slow collapse.</p>
        
        <p>The storm seems<br>
        to give up,<br>
        loosen its tight grasp<br>
        on the rain<br>
        and the light.<br>
        The sound of its drums<br>
        has run thin.</p>
        
        <p>A white flag<br>
        ripples in the sky<br>
        and is gone<br>
        leaving just the wind<br>
        blowing through<br>
        the clear blue<br>
        with its quiet song.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Lasting But a Moment...</h2>
        
        <p>The sun has fallen<br>
        and the day's funeral<br>
        has begun,<br>
        lowering its coffin<br>
        into the earth. The<br>
        sky grows dark<br>
        with mourning.</p>
        
        <p>Wine sloshes into place<br>
        before the glasses have risen<br>
        in their toasting,<br>
        flashing with dull sparks<br>
        in the flickering light.</p>
        
        <p>The crickets are singing<br>
        in the tittering night<br>
        and the stars do shake<br>
        with laughter.</p>
        
        <p>Lights are winking<br>
        in the hereafter.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Dimly Remembered</h2>
        
        <p>A shattered green vine<br>
        spilling its wine.<br>
        I eat the shards,<br>
        use them to cut out my heart.</p>
        
        <p>I hold it aloft before the gods.<br>
        It beats its wings like a dove.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Sound Like Sleep</h2>
        
        <p>The wind shakes the trees in sobbing gusts.<br>
        The starlight shatters into falling dust.<br>
        A sound like a sleeper shifting in bed<br>
        rises.  This thread<br>
        unravels.</p>
        
        <p>An untangled web is loosed and travels,<br>
        skittering over the concrete,<br>
        sweeping once lost streets<br>
        until they're emptied.</p>
        
        <p>Dead seeds<br>
        awaken and burst.<br>
        A mad thirst<br>
        trembles in the throat<br>
        that only knows this one note,<br>
        singing its malison.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe I'll sing along, just this once.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Angle</h2>
        
        <p>So casual in that red leather chair,<br>
        the smoke scatters with a tortured air<br>
        as he taps his cigar,<br>
        the ash falls like a thick scar<br>
        sliding from a glowing wound.</p>
        
        <p>A stillness in this seething room...<br>
        He makes a gesture, a ripple of his hand.<br>
        What to make of this man?</p>
        
        <p>Something collapses beyond the wall.</p>
        
        <p>I can feel the crawl<br>
        of my hands as they spider<br>
        along the wood.  Tighter<br>
        and tighter, they strangle<br>
        the place I sit.  An angle</p>
        
        <p>I throw between us<br>
        could be what<br>
        saves me in the end<br>
        but where will I be then?</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Fall</h2>
        
        <p>Something was aflutter,<br>
        wings beaten by the gutter,<br>
        crumpled and thrown away.</p>
        
        <p>I saw you flailing in the wind one day,<br>
        whispering when you touched the ground,<br>
        and I thought to myself, what now?</p>
        
        <p>I could barely make you out<br>
        over this new sound<br>
        and you were dirty in your<br>
        tarantella, smudged and impure.</p>
        
        <p>You had sold all that was left<br>
        and you were twisted into a dress<br>
        that was far too small.</p>
        
        <p>Oh, how the mighty do fall.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>In the Orchard</h2>
        
        <p>The cold white burn of stars<br>
        flecks the sky like sugar,<br>
        the cold white softness<br>
        soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>The white earth of the grave.</p>
        
        <p>White sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>White snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        by a crystalline brook<br>
        that's laughing over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
         
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing,<br>
        like a scream.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Remnants of Autumn</h2>
        
        <p>Autumn corn of autumn leaves<br>
        in orange and red and yellow.</p>
        
        <p>Vernal leaves drift in the wind<br>
        like white icebergs on the sea.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed, as always, in black,<br>
        I walk through this storm of leaves<br>
        until the soft warm rain subsides<br>
        and I find a clear little waterfall<br>
        formed of crooked silver-grey rock,<br>
        like a moon directing the warm waters.</p>
        
        <p>The moon shines<br>
        over a black stretch of forests<br>
        and snow white as the moon.</p>
        
        <p>The bark is black<br>
        as with a burning<br>
        and caked with snow<br>
        like white gauze.</p>
        
        <p>Burned by the fiery colors of autumn,<br>
        the fields are ablaze with indian corn.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Many Darknesses</h2>
        
        <p>A dark street curves upward<br>
        through the night,<br>
        drenched in loneliness.</p>
        
        <p>Peach-colored streetlamps<br>
        burn alone in the emptiness.</p>
        
        <p>A yellow candle burns<br>
        behind the dark pane<br>
        of a window.</p>
        
        <p>I put my palm to the cool glass<br>
        then rest my head there as if to sleep<br>
        and now I sit with my head resting in my hand,<br>
        weeping, at the brown table<br>
        upon which the candle sits.</p>
        
        <p>A candle burns<br>
        in a red glass<br>
        bloodying a bedroom<br>
        with a doleful light.</p>
        
        <p>I stare at the red sunset on the horizon<br>
        through a sliding glass door<br>
        over the shapes of black-green conifers.</p>
        
        <p>Night falls deep and blue.</p>
        
        <p>A black chandelier<br>
        is dimmed to eerie embers.</p>
        
        <p>Darkness waits in an open door.<br>
        The door slams closed on its own.</p>
        
        <p>An old wooden gate<br>
        swings back and forth<br>
        for no reason.</p>
        
        <p>A pale blue flash of lightning<br>
        reveals a child<br>
        standing in the middle of the night<br>
        clutching a doll.</p>
        
        <p>She has pale skin<br>
        and she stares at me<br>
        with her black irises.</p>
        
        <p>At that moment, everything ends.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Insensate</h2>
        
        <p>An arching black-streaked gate<br>
        protects a solid darkness.</p>
        
        <p>Massive dark tree trunks<br>
        huddle together,<br>
        whispering.</p>
        
        <p>Water drips<br>
        from the stalagtites<br>
        onto dark<br>
        subterranean pools.</p>
        
        <p>Someone stands silhouetted<br>
        in the entrance to the cave.</p>
        
        <p>He's staring at me<br>
        through slits of light.</p>
        
        <p>A torch burns<br>
        in a sconce<br>
        with a crayon fire.</p>
        
        <p>Up ahead the path divides,<br>
        each choice unappealing.</p>
        
        <p>A square of light<br>
        floats through<br>
        an abandoned room.</p>
        
        <p>Gossamer curtains<br>
        move in an unfelt wind.</p>
        
        <p>Insensate.</p>
