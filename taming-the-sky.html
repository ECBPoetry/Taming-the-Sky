        <h2>Invocation</h2>
        
        <p>Yahweh Allah Jesus Ahura Mazda Eris<br>
        reclining on the pages of a book,<br>
        you look like the night sky,<br>
        as cold as the Absolute.<br>
        Bring me your emptiness<br>
        so that I may be free.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Foundlings</h2>
        
        <p>The night is dark<br>
        and there is nothing in the sky.</p>
        
        <p>There is a cold in the heights.<br>
        A frozen tarn<br>
        lays impassive on the peak<br>
        and a brutal wind does sweep<br>
        across the meadows,<br>
        crackling among the broken snow.</p>
        
        <p>Flames shiver in a ring of stone<br>
        and a foundling trembles<br>
        in a quaking dance,<br>
        hearkening to the freezing chant<br>
        of the night's syllables of snow<br>
        that not so much resemble<br>
        as suggest the clouds<br>
        smeared across the blue tableau<br>
        some hours ago<br>
        before he reached out and stole<br>
        those sparks from the night,<br>
        before the stars grew unwilling,<br>
        when he could still see<br>
        those pale inkblots in the sky.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Hobbyhorse</h2>
        
        <p>The bones of the beast<br>
        have cracked and split,<br>
        breaking apart in the line,<br>
        its inertia running out<br>
        in the petrified pines,<br>
        as the teeth of drought<br>
        are bleaching into white.</p>
        
        <p>The salt of the sea<br>
        has risen and fallen,<br>
        burning out in the sun,<br>
        the sand sweeping past<br>
        where a river did run,<br>
        where cowboys are riding fast,<br>
        firing their wooden guns.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Crossing</h2>
        
        <p>Cold white bars<br>
        of light slide<br>
        through the dark<br>
        as the wind rattles<br>
        a closing note.</p>
        
        <p>The sun shatters<br>
        in the sea's engulfing throat,<br>
        the result<br>
        of unstoppable decline.</p>
        
        <p>The sea's lumbering strides<br>
        propel it to the mark<br>
        and it lifts a stealthy hand<br>
        to scribble in a cursive pen<br>
        on the disappearing land.</p>
        
        <p>The distance<br>
        between coasts<br>
        grows thin.</p>
        
        <p>Foaming ghosts<br>
        breach the ocean.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Cage's Lost Symphony</h2>
        
        <p>The room is a white hand<br>
        holding a bird of smoke<br>
        whose body billows forth<br>
        in the sharp staccato<br>
        of a vibrating laugh.<br>
        Drops of wine pound<br>
        below the beat of forks<br>
        on fine china drums.</p>
        
        <p>The sky holds a smoking gun<br>
        and a fog grips the fence,<br>
        its fingers twisted around<br>
        the chain's metal throat<br>
        in a rattling ascent.<br>
        Drops of rust fleck the street<br>
        and somewhere a dying machine<br>
        screeches its final note.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Unearthed</h2>
        
        <p>His flashlight waves<br>
        its wand of light<br>
        above the crowd of pine<br>
        that creaks in applause<br>
        at his every step<br>
        on the dusty stage.</p>
        
        <p>The emptiness thrusts<br>
        its swords of dark<br>
        through illusion's heart<br>
        as a curtain drops<br>
        inside his chest<br>
        before a crowd of blood.</p>
        
        <p>Slowly the umbra<br>
        of a burning wick<br>
        draws with its shade,<br>
        and now a stain<br>
        creeps along<br>
        the empty canvas.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly the rust<br>
        of unending nights<br>
        explodes with a crack,<br>
        and somewhere a clap<br>
        resounds beyond<br>
        the sweeping light.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Tenders of the Garden</h2>
        
        <p>Roses explode:<br>
        a red flowering<br>
        beating in the<br>
        bloodless garden.</p>
        
        <p>Lightning strobes:<br>
        a blue flowing<br>
        throbbing in the<br>
        pulsing rain.</p>
        
        <p>Wet thorns soak the bush,<br>
        rain from wooden clouds,<br>
        leaving on secret flesh<br>
        the mark of the hidden.</p>
        
        <p>The moon chances a look,<br>
        whispers under the boughs,<br>
        clambers over the fence&mdash;<br>
        a pale shadow on the run.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Spindrift</h2>
        
        <p>The moon is a lure,<br>
        sinking in the night.<br>
        The waves are a cipher<br>
        scrawled upon the tide.<br>
        The clouds are a blur,<br>
        foaming across the sky.<br>
        The wind is a sailor<br>
        screaming in the brine.</p>
        
        <p>A line is sent<br>
        into the dark.<br>
        A man will dredge<br>
        amongst the stars.</p>
        
        <p>Down below the silent guest,<br>
        hooks begin their search.<br>
        Down past the water's flesh,<br>
        something stills its birth.<br>
        Down beside the haunted wreck,<br>
        lines begin their lurch.<br>
        Down in the black depths,<br>
        something awaits its capture.</p>
        
        <p>The sea whitens<br>
        in the moon's grip.<br>
        The man is thrown<br>
        down its silent throat.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Beginning of Night</h2>
        
        <p>Words are throbbing in the light.<br>
        Grinding gears are shaking,<br>
        rattling in the wind.<br>
        They're humming the lines<br>
        the keys are playing<br>
        as they chatter<br>
        in the cold.</p>
        
        <p>Fog is billowing<br>
        as the light changes<br>
        and the fool dances<br>
        before his mic.</p>
        
        <p>The light shatters<br>
        in its strobing,<br>
        the bits<br>
        falling in the crowd.<br>
        In the front row<br>
        a zealot rages,<br>
        grasping after the damaged<br>
        and twisted lights,<br>
        while, from the stage,<br>
        a laughter sounds<br>
        at this ending of days.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Three</h2>
        
        <p>Trees rattle<br>
        bars of sunlight.<br>
        Leaves wriggle<br>
        locks of Pinyon Pine.</p>
        
        <p>Leaves twist on the branch<br>
        like the turning of keys.</p>
        
        <p> * * *</p>
        
        <p>Autumn bursts like a match<br>
        before the glowing of trees,</p>
        
        <p>exhales the<br>
        dim smoke of night,<br>
        inhales the<br>
        last bit of sky.</p>
        
        <p> * * *</p>
        
        <p>Hear the engine's roar<br>
        on White or Paper Birch,</p>
        
        <p>penning a tale of roads<br>
        in long and lazy curves.</p>
        <br>



        <h2>Two</h2>
        
        <p>The shattered road blinked<br>
        with its broken streelights.</p>
        
        <p>The mouth of traffic opened<br>
        as if prepared to scream.</p>
        
        <p>Tears of burning gas.<br>
        The traffic went blind.</p>
        
        <p>The road's teeth were broken<br>
        trying to chew the black.</p>
        
        <p> * * *</p>
        
        <p>Sunlight vows played<br>
        with burning syllables.</p>
        
        <p>Then came the orders<br>
        from the screaming blaze.</p>
        
        <p>The sparkling sibilants.<br>
        The glowing vowels.</p>
        
        <p>All the fiery words<br>
        soon to be extinguished.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Turning On</h2>
        
        <p>Candles wink<br>
        at the sight<br>
        of the dervishes.</p>
        
        <p>Dust whirls<br>
        through the temple<br>
        of the night.</p>
        
        <p>Silence sings<br>
        its quiet prayers<br>
        throughout the crypt.</p>
        
        <p>Winds curl<br>
        through the temple<br>
        of dead air.</p>
        
        <p>Enflamed worshippers<br>
        burn anointing oil<br>
        and minds combust,</p>
        
        <p>throwing sparks<br>
        in blinking signs,<br>
        flashes on tinfoil</p>
        
        <p>now fractured<br>
        in a breaking<br>
        of the spectrum,</p>
        
        <p>growing dark<br>
        with blinking signs,<br>
        eyefuls of sleep.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ex Nihilo</h2>
        
        <p>Next to the church<br>
        green stalks of light<br>
        pierce the darkness of earth.</p>
        
        <p>In the spacious cloth<br>
        floats a pale star,<br>
        the tiniest of white dots.</p>
        
        <p>His eye is pierced<br>
        in its bleeding sight<br>
        by a thrusting green spear.</p>
        
        <p>Clawing at cold soil<br>
        empty as the sky,<br>
        he dives into the void.</p>
        
        <p>Winds play the thornbush<br>
        like a distant harp<br>
        as the vacant angels should.</p>
        
        <p>A rootless blossom opens,<br>
        winks its red eye.<br>
        A long winter has ended.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Patient Sky</h2>
        
        <p>Summer's towers turn to sand<br>
        with a surge of the patient sky.</p>
        
        <p>Autumnal cities are melting<br>
        in the slow assault of rain.</p>
        
        <p>The nights are growing festive<br>
        and the winter's flurries deep.</p>
        
        <p> * * *</p>
        
        <p>There is a vacant craft<br>
        rotting in the brine.</p>
        
        <p>A storm's white eye blinks<br>
        in the depths of a blue grave.</p>
        
        <p>The ghosts are growing restless<br>
        as they bob in the distilling seas.</p>
        
        <p> * * *</p>
        
        <p>The green tongue's lash<br>
        whips the last of the ice.</p>
        
        <p>The loud voice of spring<br>
        resonates in the frozen glade.</p>
        
        <p>The winds are taken to screaming<br>
        and to the sowing of seeds.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Passing Through</h2>
        
        <p>The night<br>
        swings its bat<br>
        at an orange sun<br>
        and it shatters<br>
        into twilight.<br>
        Seeds of light<br>
        are scattered<br>
        across the sky<br>
        as the darkness runs.</p>
        
        <p>Behind its mask<br>
        a ghost pursues<br>
        the night<br>
        as the winds<br>
        pass through<br>
        the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Torn from their husk<br>
        the stars fly free,<br>
        hurtling through space.</p>
        
        <p>The ghost caresses its new face<br>
        and, though by night winds unmoved,<br>
        the garb<br>
        it wears is unwinding<br>
        like the fading of the mist<br>
        in the risen sun.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Quiet Song</h2>
        
        <p>The sky waves<br>
        its banner,<br>
        it whips in the wind,<br>
        and light rain<br>
        sounds a march<br>
        across the damp earth.</p>
        
        <p>With a spark<br>
        the storm's rapid fuse<br>
        is ablaze.<br>
        The daylight explodes<br>
        with a crash,<br>
        metal contorting<br>
        through the sky.</p>
        
        <p>In the haze<br>
        twisted wreckage looms<br>
        and settles<br>
        in a slow collapse.</p>
        
        <p>The storm seems<br>
        to give up,<br>
        loosen its tight grasp<br>
        on the rain<br>
        and the light.<br>
        The sound of its drums<br>
        has run thin.</p>
        
        <p>A white flag<br>
        ripples in the sky<br>
        and is gone<br>
        leaving just the wind<br>
        blowing through<br>
        the clear blue<br>
        with its quiet song.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Hereafter</h2>
        
        <p>The stars are lowering<br>
        the day's blue coffin<br>
        into the charred horizon.</p>
        
        <p>Falling stars sting<br>
        the mourners' black eyes,<br>
        blurring their bruised sight.</p>
        
        <p>The priest, in flames,<br>
        clutches his burning tome<br>
        as the blackened pages moan.</p>
        
        <p>The priest's searing praise<br>
        ignites the gathered crowd,<br>
        who disperse into the clouds.</p>
        
        <p>In the dark a mime<br>
        going through the motions<br>
        stops to listen to the crickets</p>
        
        <p>sing in the tittering night,<br>
        the stars shake with laughter.<br>
        Lights are winking in the hereafter.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Mapmaker</h2>
        
        <p>An illegible scrawl<br>
        surrenders to the sky<br>
        in a sandy fall.</p>
        
        <p>A vision smoothed<br>
        by sandblasted eyes<br>
        rises from the dunes.</p>
        
        <p>A page sanded clean,<br>
        completely whited-out,<br>
        redacted, and bleached.</p>
        
        <p>The storm touches the page,<br>
        its hand covering the mouth<br>
        of a disintegrating age.</p>
        
        <p>A smudged cipher.<br>
        A muffled dirge.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Taming the Sky</h2>
        
        <p>A silence misty<br>
        with the choking sky.<br>
        Fingers of rain<br>
        entered the throat<br>
        of the lightning's cry.</p>
        
        <p>Storms inbreed,<br>
        waters commingled<br>
        in the grey,<br>
        flow unopposed<br>
        over the shingles.</p>
        
        <p>A sound glided<br>
        like a candle<br>
        from the mouth<br>
        of an eclipsed sun:<br>
        a guttering babble.</p>
        
        <p>A tamed lion's<br>
        roaring<br>
        settles down<br>

        not morning.</p>

        <h2>Corpus</h2>
        
        <p>The shadowy tread of night<br>
        moves with starry steps.<br>
        It's sneaking up behind<br>
        a nonevent.</p>
        
        <p>The horizon's blade takes<br>
        the pulse of twilight.<br>
        Anemic blue waylaid<br>
        by the zeitgeist.</p>
        
        <p>Emptying the parched skies<br>
        of the illusion of rain.<br>
        The starlight<br>
        unchained.</p>
        
        <p>Here lies the body of the sky,<br>
        the empty outline of clouds.<br>
        Here where the dead pantomime.<br>
        Here where the wind is unwound.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Guest</h2>
        
        <p>It bows to the wind,<br>
        murmurs an obsequity<br>
        of deconstruction<br>
        in the milkweed.</p>
        
        <p>The crumbling facade,<br>
        in disintegration,<br>
        sheds its cells:<br>
        a trickling of stars,<br>
        like constellations<br>
        undoing themselves.</p>
        
        <p>A vandal defaces<br>
        the fragile skin:<br>
        dripping phrases<br>
        red and swollen.</p>
        
        <p>A polite gesture<br>
        of invitation<br>
        to the weather:<br>
        a door's dislocation.</p>
        
        <p>Its mouth is open,<br>
        its tongue is quelled.<br>
        A rope lies broken<br>
        in the forgotten well.</p>

        <h2>Shattered</h2>
        
        <p>Cloudy forms writhing<br>
        in a vague discourse<br>
        of blurry cuneiform<br>
        are crystallizing</p>
        
        <p>into sparkling knives<br>
        held to the arteries<br>
        of shattered memory:<br>
        a threatening slice</p>
        
        <p>of a jagged artifact.<br>
        The modern talk<br>
        of the kidnapped<br>
        lies hurt, sprawled</p>
        
        <p>on the broken letters<br>
        of shattered words.<br>
        The silence surrenders<br>
        to a wordless murmur.</p>

        <h2>The Beating of Wings</h2>
        
        <p>Just one small slip and<br>
        a green vine is shattering,<br>
        spraying drunken blood</p>
        
        <p>across the witchgrass.<br>
        Provoked by this injury<br>
        a deep momentum</p>
        
        <p>takes me by the hand,<br>
        grabs hold of the jagged leaves,<br>
        liberates my heart</p>
        
        <p>from its dark crevasse.<br>
        Inside, the red baptistry<br>
        drips with the high art</p>
        
        <p>of this sacrifice.<br>
        My heart, finally unstuck,<br>
        flutters with freedom</p>
        
        <p>and begins to rise.<br>
        It beats its wings like a dove,<br>
        flapping only once.</p>

        <h2>Vacant Ground</h2>
        
        <p>Quickly starlight dust<br>
        vanishes in a white puff<br>
        of darkling magic.</p>
        
        <p>As the plot blackens,<br>
        slowly a thread unravels<br>
        in the blind vandal's</p>
        
        <p>blood. Crimson trolleys<br>
        clatter, sweeping the lost streets<br>
        until they're empty.</p>
        
        <p>Vacant ground: dead seeds<br>
        shift, stir, awaken, and burst<br>
        in arid splendor.</p>
        
        <p>And now a mad thirst<br>
        is trembling in the throat,<br>
        singing its one note,</p>
        
        <p>ringing forever,<br>
        the sound of the unanswered<br>
        finally shattered.</p>

        <h2>Angle</h2>
        
        <p>Massing on the east edge<br>
        of the chair, a smokiness<br>
        flanks a battered cigar.<br>
        Ash falls like a thick scar<br>
        sliding from a glowing wound<br>
        when he but barely moves.</p>
        
        <p>His chair offers a plea<br>
        and I hear something<br>
        collapse beyond the wall.</p>
        
        <p>Ice drops into the alcohol,<br>
        a celestial body disappearing<br>
        into that small clear sea.<br>
        Pounding walls of melted sand,<br>
        it cracks its frozen hands<br>
        on an invisible prison.</p>
        
        <p>My hands grip the glassy finish<br>
        of these two broken arms,<br>
        knotted in wooden scars<br>
        like little pine glyphs,<br>
        as I strangle the place I sit.</p>
        
        <p>What has the keenness<br>
        to scar the flat cement<br>
        of the dried brick heart<br>
        of a man this parched?<br>
        What tortured sestina<br>
        can I throw between us?<br>
        What repetition can refute<br>
        the refrains of bleak truth<br>
        that a loaded gun speaks?</p>

        <p>A splash of white wings<br>
        ripples the blacktop river<br>
        as a scribble of dark water<br>
        crosses the stunted pages.</p>
        
        <p>Fingers of black sewage<br>
        turn whispering pages<br>
        as the storm rocks<br>
        in its splashing chair.</p>
        
        <p>The treadstone hisses<br>
        its rolling headlines<br>
        then suddenly swerves<br>
        to pick up the news<br>
        with splashing hands.</p>
        
        <p>The paper rips apart<br>
        like an exploding star,<br>
        shattering under<br>
        the undercarriage,<br>

        with words unsightly<br>

        <p>The dead described,<br>
        forever unforgotten,<br>
        the wordless scribes<br>
        dropped their pens<br>
        to clutch sand instead.</p>
        
        <p>Arcane words on vellum<br>
        emptied out the spectrum.<br>
        The incandescent flicker<br>

        dimmed stars to a cinder.</p>
        
        <p>The day's frail ghost<br>
        shakes all the bones<br>
        that it possesses<br>
        to lose the unforgotten<br>
        in a macabre procession.</p>

        <h2>Valet Parking</h2>
        
        <p>The city is scrawling<br>
        in thin black lines<br>
        of calligrapher's art,<br>
        its cars sighing<br>
        across pages of night.</p>
        
        <p>White suits foam<br>
        in a sea of valets<br>
        as the muse rises<br>
        from the glass shell.</p>
        
        <p>Her anonymous escort,<br>
        his teeth trying<br>
        to catch the light,<br>
        dangles from her arm.</p>
        
        <p>Random muses spring<br>
        from the asphalt ocean<br>
        crashing against these<br>
        hungry shores.</p>

        <p>The sweet rose's sound<br>
        accents the wafting tongues<br>
        of billboard preachers.</p>
        
        <p>Here at the crossroads,<br>
        sour apples tempt the shrunken,<br>
        who no longer reach.</p>
        
        <p>The lotus blossom<br>
        flickers open on the screen<br>
        to sing of emptiness.</p>
        
        <p>The sleepwalkers step<br>
        into the mouths of their gowns,<br>
        mumbling bedtime tales.</p>
        
        <p>Here, where the world ends,<br>
        unwounded dragons awake<br>
        the devourer.</p>

        <p>He serenades the sky.<br>
        He wraps his voice<br>
        around the rain.</p>
        
        <p>Her black dress rustles<br>
        across the dry tiles<br>

        <p>He serenades the sky.<br>
        He pushes his tongue<br>
        inside the rain.</p>
        
        <p>Her blue shoes light<br>
        up the gray floor<br>
        with rain.</p>
        
        <p>He punctuates the weather.<br>
        He stills his breath<br>
        before the rain.</p>
        
        <p>Her black steps blow<br>
        up the dry sands<br>
        with rain.</p>
        
        <p>He punctuates the weather.<br>
        He closes his mouth<br>

        a rustling cry.</p>
        
        <p>Summer's drooling tongue<br>
        writhes around me,<br>
        its violet mouth<br>
        full of sap.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn's disappearing sky<br>

        <p>The burning of stars flecks<br>
        the sky like spilled sugar,<br>
        the cold white light<br>
        as soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>There is white earth on the grave.</p>
        
        <p>There are white sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>There is white snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        sits by a crystalline brook<br>
        that laughs over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing<br>
        like a scream.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Green icebergs drift<br>
        on a sea of spring.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed in black<br>
        I slide through<br>
        the storm of leaves<br>
        until its soft<br>
        rain subsides<br>
        and I find a<br>
        little waterfall<br>
        rolling across<br>
        silver-gray rock<br>
        like a moon<br>
        directing the<br>
        warm waters.</p>
        
        <p>The moon shines<br>
        over a black stretch<br>
        of forests covered<br>
        with lunar snow.</p>
        
        <p>The bark is black<br>
        as with a burning<br>
        and caked with snow<br>
        like white gauze.</p>
        
        <p>Burning in the<br>

        <p>A black street curves<br>
        through an empty night.<br>
        Peaches smolder<br>
        their cold light<br>
        across the asphalt.</p>
        
        <p>A yellow candle burns<br>
        behind the dark pane<br>
        of a window.</p>
        
        <p>I put my palm<br>
        to the cool glass<br>
        then rest my head<br>
        as if to sleep<br>
        and now I cry<br>
        at the brown table<br>
        upon which the candle sits.</p>
        
        <p>A candle burns<br>
        in a red glass<br>

        <p>Night spreads its deep blue<br>

        <p>Darkness waits<br>
        in an open door.<br>
        The door closes.</p>
        
        <p>An old wooden gate<br>
        swings back and forth<br>
        in the dying yard.</p>
        
        <p>A pale blue flash of lightning<br>
        reveals a child<br>
        standing in the middle of the night<br>
        clutching a doll.</p>
        
        <p>She has pale skin<br>
        and she stares at me<br>

        <p>Someone stands silhouetted<br>
        in the entrance to the cave.</p>
        
        <p>He's staring at me<br>

        <p>A torch burns<br>
        in a sconce<br>
        with a crayon fire.</p>
        
        <p>Up ahead the path divides,<br>

        <p>A square of light<br>
        floats through<br>
        an abandoned room.</p>
        
        <p>Gossamer curtains<br>

        <h2>Away, Into, Away</h2>
        
        <p>In the chill blue air<br>
        a purple flower<br>
        peels itself open,<br>
        stretching until<br>
        its petals fall away.</p>
        
        <p>One of them spirals<br>
        through a vast,<br>
        roaring emptiness<br>
        until it's frozen<br>
        in a block of ice.</p>
        
        <p>A naked woman in a blue room,<br>
        filled with silence and water,<br>
        strides down flooded stairs<br>
        into the cold embrace<br>
        of a freezing pool,<br>
        a small smile floating<br>
        to the surface of her face.</p>
        
        <p>In the burning yellow air,<br>
        a woman closes her book<br>
        and rises to her feet.<br>
        She tosses her book<br>
        into the pool<br>
        as she walks away.<br>
        It goes quietly<br>
        into the water,<br>
        its pages still dry.</p>

        <h2>Against the Silence</h2>
        
        <p>A gold crown rests<br>
        on a cushion of night.<br>
        A soft whispering<br>
        in the dark.</p>
        
        <p>The wind is gentle<br>
        in the green leaves<br>
        of a murmuring forest.</p>
        
        <p>Coins are falling<br>
        in a quiet rain,<br>
        soaking velvet.</p>
        
        <p>A man moves through<br>
        a faint blue storm,<br>
        hard footsteps<br>
        on cold asphalt.</p>
        
        <p>A car keeps driving<br>
        on through the dark,<br>
        lit by dirty yellow light.<br>
        The tires' low growl<br>
        yelps to a stop.</p>
        
        <p>An empty house,<br>
        its cold panels flat<br>
        against the silence.<br>
        Welcome home.</p>

        <p>The air is cool and still:<br>
        white streaks in blue marble.<br>
        Crickets are singing offstage.</p>
        
        <p>A bush waves in greeting<br>
        with its dusty green hand<br>
        while it whispers something<br>
        in your ear.</p>
        
        <p>A coarse path lies before you,<br>
        graying into the cold distance.<br>
        Your steps are hungry<br>
        and they crunch the miles,<br>
        with the mouth of the garden open.</p>
        
        <p>A burgundy flower is there,<br>
        the thorns daring you<br>
        to pick up the glass,<br>
        to know the taste<br>
        you'll never have.</p>
        
        <p>Sapphire burns in the sky;<br>
        sounds like a shattering,<br>
        tastes like glass: sweet.</p>
        
        <p>Don't you think it's time<br>

        <p>The rain stumbles,<br>
        tripping on salted earth,<br>
        collapsing into silt seas.</p>
        
        <p>The waves scribble<br>
        on the blank tides<br>
        with their blue pen<br>
        until the ink runs low.</p>
        
        <p>The ground is erased<br>
        in whispering strokes<br>

        But those doors open onto<br>
        a horrifying realm of infinite</p>
        
        <p>obscenity with a maelstrom<br>
        of boundless corruption<br>
        contorting in the center<br>
        in a howling slipstream<br>
        glowing with a wet sheen.</p>
        
        <p>As I creak the doors open,<br>
        I feel the darkness deepen,<br>
        moving in a crimson slither<br>
        through my quickening blood.<br>
        Through the screaming ether</p>
        
        <p>a familiar voice reverberates<br>
        the words of distorted rites<br>
        that sound ancient and foreign,<br>
        a voice I'm hear to murder.<br>
        Into my wrist, I carve a rune</p>
        
        <p>of the most perfect uniformity,<br>
        and raise my flowing stigmata<br>
        far above my reeling head.<br>

        <p>rises from the machinery<br>
        to rest on your tongue<br>

        finding your voice absent.<br>
        You can hear the calls</p>

        as they're asphyxiating.<br>
        Their insides are aglow<br>

        into the shape of force.</p>
        
        <p>They twist and they unwind<br>
        contorting something fierce<br>
        as they painfully carve</p>
        
        <p>the newest demanded shape<br>
        from their breaking fibers<br>
        in a strange unravelling.</p>

        <p>This act of stellar arson<br>
        grows dark in the firefight,<br>

        a parasol twirls across the sun.</p>
        
        <p>Dying flames sigh in unison<br>
        in a long smokeless defeat<br>
        and now nothing can be seen.</p>

        He is casting a dark malison<br>
        as he stares into a mirror.</p>
        
        <p>In the circle stands a mammoth<br>
        figure with eyes that smolder<br>
        with lies. A smoking artifice<br>
        sneaks out of the trapdoor<br>
        of his voice. "It's your career</p>
        
        <p>that's at stake," he says.<br>
        "Finish what you've started.<br>
        Now give your name to me<br>
        and enter into my servitude."<br>
        He couldn't stand to pause,</p>
        
        <p>to endure this yearning. Seize<br>
        the day! Fame is in that fire!<br>
        And the real enemy here is time.<br>

        as he looks down and hesitates.</p>
        
        <p>He kneels as if in tribute<br>
        to a storm of his dreaming,<br>
        one that left him a nomad,<br>
        one with no more chances.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Open Book</h2>
        
        <p>A broken promise of rain<br>
        darkens the cracked terrain<br>
        with its dry half-light.</p>
        
        <p>A world of withering<br>
        crunches underfoot like jaws<br>
        grinding in a sleeper's mouth.</p>
        
        <p>The wind will carve with its dirk<br>
        as it draws the summoner's rune<br>
        where once the storm crooked<br>
        the land with its weathering,<br>
        when the land's broken pages<br>
        were the playground of myth,<br>
        when the ink was still black<br>
        where the arcane letters ran,<br>
        when the book never creaked<br>
        as dried pages shattered.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Prophecy</h2>
        
        <p>In this twisted landscape<br>
        dying trees are growing<br>
        and brown grass chokes<br>
        the fertile soil.</p>
        
        <p>The boiling sky is black<br>
        and it threatens rain<br>
        while a candle of wind<br>
        flickers to and fro.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond its blackboard's scope<br>
        the sky is erratically drawing<br>
        meandering lines with its chalks<br>
        across the walls of the castle,<br>
        walls that will only fray<br>
        once they've been overrun,<br>
        bleeding block by block<br>
        from a grey wound.</p>
        
        <p>Swinging in the bellfry,<br>
        a silent bell is crowing.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Last Storm of the Season</h2>
        
        <p>Cold winds are screaming<br>
        but the world is still,<br>
        untouched, not even trembling.<br>
        The waters are tinted windows,<br>
        a candle is a yellow crayon.<br>
        Everything is solid and hard.</p>
        
        <p>Serrated knives of crystal<br>
        lie frozen and unheard<br>
        in the hands of a tragedian,<br>
        its blue hands scrambling<br>
        as the lights are dimming.</p>
        
        <p>At the call of the clarion<br>
        the weather slowly dies.<br>
        The storm is disassembling<br>
        as the world turns hard.</p>
        
        <p>Slowly comes the end of days,<br>
        slowly as the winds grow still.</p>
        
        <p>And no clocks are chiming.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Arsonist</h2>
        
        <p>The flames are nodding<br>
        in the wind like a field<br>
        of flowers. The clouds<br>
        are billows of white smoke.</p>
        
        <p>A parade of red uniforms<br>
        marches to the music of fire.<br>
        The popping of embers<br>
        crackles like a snare drum.<br>
        The flames a brass section<br>
        roaring expressionist sounds.</p>
        
        <p>He slowly dons his smock<br>
        and opens the red vial,<br>
        grabs the canvas of fire.<br>
        He licks the tongue of flame<br>
        and from nowhere, a trail&mdash;<br>
        a scribble&mdash;of heat blossoms<br>
        with the logic of a dream.</p>
        
        <p>As the words turned florid<br>
        and the soul turned to smoke,<br>
        he looked at the blank clouds<br>
        as words set fire to everything.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Into the Forest</h2>
        
        <p>The prairie is crashing<br>
        in slow motion waves.<br>
        A shower of birdsong<br>
        explodes in the groves.</p>
        
        <p>A green ocean is broken<br>
        as the trees surface<br>
        so they can breathe in<br>
        a strained susurrus.</p>
        
        <p>Their olive heads sink<br>
        back beneath the grass.<br>
        From the prairie's conch<br>
        comes a drowning voice.</p>
        
        <p>Out of this whirlpool<br>
        crawls a sodden ghost,<br>
        clawing toward the maple,<br>
        reaching into the forest.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Dictation</h2>
        
        <p>Frothing mouths<br>
        clench their questions,<br>
        lick clean their myths<br>
        like bloodsoaked tines.</p>
        
        <p>Trembling hands<br>
        clench their quills,<br>
        shake their empty pens,<br>
        shattered useless foils.</p>
        
        <p>Paper armor<br>
        questions the flame,<br>
        follows up with ash.</p>
        
        <p>Potent grammar<br>
        quiets a treasonous claim,<br>
        fits answers on the flesh.</p>
        
        <p>Our blood<br>
        is their scribble.</p>
        
        <p>Their blood<br>
        is our bauble:</p>
        
        <p>glimmer in the fire.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Riding the Asphalt</h2>
        
        <p>The wind ties off<br>
        the alley's vein<br>
        with a bit of chaff<br>
        blown from the drain.</p>
        
        <p>Drops of yellow junk<br>
        flow through asphalt.<br>
        Cautionary lights blink<br>
        and the blood is spilt.</p>
        
        <p>The blood cells hum,<br>
        vibrate, and thrum.<br>
        A green eye opens<br>
        above the bloodstains.</p>
        
        <p>A shuddering engine<br>
        dies somewhere within.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Dive</h2>
        
        <p>He stands there cold and naked,<br>
        shivering before the gelid water.<br>
        Its dark blue surface staring<br>
        at him, looking so uninviting.</p>
        
        <p>What will it be like, the shock<br>
        of the ice as it cocoons him?<br>
        And what dark things lie below<br>
        its surface, slumbering there?</p>
        
        <p>He remembers when the wind cooed<br>
        with a cold that wasn't bitter,<br>
        with a voice that was reassuring<br>
        and whose songs were riveting.</p>
        
        <p>He readies himself with a shake<br>
        as hard as his body will allow.<br>
        He can feel his blood slither<br>
        as his heart works its mayhem.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe the pool will grow whiter,<br>
        the decision will be made for him<br>
        by the icy whims of the weather.<br>
        If he can't dive into the hollow,<br>
        bubbly arches of this ice arcade<br>
        then he's free from discovering<br>
        what's down there quietly waiting<br>
        on the other side of the water.</p>
        
        <p>He's probably still standing there...</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Transmission</h2>
        
        <p>Stormclouds tumble across the sky.<br>
        The future is blowing black smoke<br>
        into the night's starless canopy.<br>
        Its quiet footsteps can be heard<br>
        in the distance as it approaches.<br>
        The chill you feel is its spies<br>
        as they slide invisibly past you.</p>
        
        <p>Inexorably, its steps grow louder<br>
        until their roar becomes seismic.<br>
        Soon the sound will fully occupy<br>
        the atmosphere in quick blanches<br>
        of terror at the oncoming horde.</p>
        
        <p>All you can sense is the audio,<br>
        the harsh signal you suppose<br>
        must be the air gone all askew,<br>
        as the thing reaches the border.</p>
        
        <p>Then the wind gone suddenly hard.</p>
        
        <p>And the clouds an empty smock<br>
        drifting slow and phantasmic.</p>
        
        <p>Then the rain as it drenches.</p>
        
        <p>And the touch on your shoulder,<br>
        the white noise from the stereo.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Healing</h2>
        
        <p>It's a placid shade of blue,<br>
        this thing that fills my vision<br>
        as if it was the sum of being.</p>
        
        <p>And it's a warm shade of blue,<br>
        this thing that fills my pores,<br>
        as if it was an amniotic sea.</p>
        
        <p>It's a quiet whisper of wind,<br>
        this sound that fills my ears<br>
        as if it was my own monologue.</p>
        
        <p>It's a quiet lapping of wind,<br>
        this sound that fills my sigh<br>
        as if it was a nice diversion.</p>
        
        <p>The beauty of this tableau<br>
        and my fear are parleying,<br>
        are in some sort of dialogue.</p>
        
        <p>The silence of this tableau<br>
        and my peace are magnifiers,<br>
        are the serenity that appears.</p>
        
        <p>My lungs are just a wound<br>
        waiting for an infusion<br>
        of the healing sea.</p>
        
        <p>My life is just a wound<br>
        awaiting the conveying<br>
        of the epilogue.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>One with Everything</h2>
        
        <p>It's been raining for days.<br>
        Grey drops are descending<br>
        in those huge blurry waves<br>
        that indistinguish objects.</p>
        
        <p>Everything is drab wetness,<br>
        everything slowly dissolves<br>
        into the fall's white noise<br>
        and into its senseless cold.</p>
        
        <p>The land swirling in eddies<br>
        as the ground is conceding<br>
        to a flood that reweaves<br>
        all into a new wholeness.</p>
        
        <p>With fear, the steeplejacks<br>
        finally resign themselves<br>
        to their drowning destinies,<br>
        being relentlessly encircled<br>
        by the slow, jostling bodies<br>
        of their friends serenading<br>
        them in rainy crescendos<br>
        that fill the damp airwaves<br>
        with their malformed objects.</p>
        
        <p>Perched atop their antennas,<br>
        they slowly steel themselves<br>
        before singing their threnodies,<br>
        songs bright and monotonous.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Longest Moment</h2>
        
        <p>The earth is frosted white<br>
        and I exhale a tiny ghost<br>
        in the crackling, icy still.</p>
        
        <p>A clear stream is tumbling over<br>
        a field of round black rocks<br>
        in the quietest murmuring voice.</p>
        
        <p>The distant baying of a hound<br>
        slaps me with its icy palm.</p>
        
        <p>I stumble into the glassy wet<br>
        shattering the quiet crystal<br>
        stream as I slosh upriver.</p>
        
        <p>Just then a low, howling gust<br>
        starts to make me nervous<br>
        with its strange atmospherics.</p>
        
        <p>I empty into my shaking hand<br>
        my last 3 tabs of diazepam.</p>
        
        <p>I jump away from the wet silver<br>
        of the freezing river's steel<br>
        glinting in a slashing hand.</p>
        
        <p>I remember that quiet druggist,<br>
        his face turning winter white,<br>
        rivers flowing from his thorax.</p>
        
        <p>What did I know? I was a novice.<br>
        I had him pegged for a pushover.</p>
        
        <p>Just then the shock of a pistol<br>
        hits me with the icy hysterics<br>
        that only now do I comprehend.</p>
        
        <p>In my soul's dark crevice,<br>
        only now, do I rediscover<br>
        that tiny moment, the longest.</p>
        
        <p>The lifting of a weight,<br>
        the emptiness in my palm.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Moral Allegory</h2>
        
        <p>These flames are more beautiful<br>
        than any of the burning canvases,<br>
        the filth on which they feast.</p>
        
        <p>These flames represent freedom:<br>
        freedom from decadence that rusts<br>
        the girders of our great society,<br>
        oxidizing them to flaming orange<br>
        until they collapse around us.</p>
        
        <p>These flames are the artful,<br>
        embodied in crackling verses,<br>
        their beauty made manifest.</p>
        
        <p>These flames are the kingdom,<br>
        the burning crown that arrests<br>
        the strokes of this atrocity,<br>
        whose violent colors derange<br>
        the senses in order to seduce.</p>
        
        <p>These flames are the sound of fall,<br>
        the crackling of broken heresies,<br>
        powder in a red fist.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Inconsequential</h2>
        
        <p>A gentle breeze feathers the air<br>
        and the page is thrust violently<br>
        through the sky's peaceful blue<br>
        that it soaks into a blurry mess.</p>
        
        <p>The wind is forming gentle spirals<br>
        that jostle the page without cease.<br>
        The wind whispers a sweet lullaby<br>
        that drowns out the written word.</p>
        
        <p>The soft blue of the weather<br>
        blurs words into blank cumuli.<br>
        The diffuseness of this tableau<br>
        makes everything turn lachrymose.</p>
        
        <p>Gentle rain fills these pastorals<br>
        with the most scathing exegesis<br>
        and the tiniest cumulonimbi<br>
        scatter everything windward.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Adagio</h2>
        
        <p>Enemies roar,<br>
        mouths distend<br>
        into black pits<br>
        as sound erupts,<br>
        fulminates in<br>
        explosive bodies.</p>
        
        <p>The trumpets<br>
        make their rips<br>
        and the garrison<br>
        slowly glissandos<br>
        into a wound<br>
        of an aria,<br>
        a beautiful roar<br>
        that will astound<br>
        all the puppets<br>
        as it unwraps<br>
        every person<br>
        with its trenodies.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, a woodwind,<br>
        a quiet whisperer,<br>
        in solemn adagio...</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Universal Solvent</h2>
        
        <p>Diving through transparent sky,<br>
        feeling the wind pour over me<br>
        with the sound of ringing glass,<br>
        tumbling in gravity's cradle.</p>
        
        <p>The clouds like spindrift<br>
        in the sloshing atmosphere<br>
        that surrounds my descent<br>
        through this neon twilight.</p>
        
        <p>As the clock grows dusky<br>
        and the sky becomes magma,<br>
        glowing with an amber gloss,<br>
        the wind turns tidal,<br>
        blowing in a lethargic updraft.</p>
        
        <p>Ever so slowly I transfer<br>
        my energy to the fluorescent<br>
        light that begins to coagulate<br>
        in the swirling flask I<br>
        use to peform this alchemy.</p>
        
        <p>The sky like a wineglass,<br>
        the light gone translucent,<br>
        the clouds like a puddle,<br>
        the wind gone pianissimo,<br>
        myself a speck in the light,<br>
        the flaw in a perfect sphere.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ode</h2>
        
        <p>Weighed down by dark matter,<br>
        the silver links stretching<br>
        with the bowing of the tray,<br>
        the device is about to break<br>
        or slip from her tired hand.</p>
        
        <p>What she carries in the other<br>
        makes a low whistling sound<br>
        as it slowly moves to and fro,<br>
        ripping an unearthly tear<br>
        with its red, bewitching<br>
        strokes into the fabric<br>
        of the tumultuous ether<br>
        she can no longer comprehend.</p>
        
        <p>Her moves a dark geometry<br>
        in the inky quicksand<br>
        of a doctrinal fray,<br>
        she lays upon the altar<br>
        the last twitching<br>
        sacrifice to bigotry,<br>
        with its single tear,<br>
        working in longhand,<br>
        pens an ode to the Father.</p>
