        <h2>In the Orchard</h2>
        
        <p>The cold white burn of stars<br>
        flecks the sky like sugar,<br>
        the cold white softness<br>
        soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>The white earth of the grave.</p>
        
        <p>White sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>White snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        by a crystalline brook<br>
        that's laughing over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
         
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing,<br>
        like a scream.</p>
