        <h2>Dimly Remembered</h2>
        
        <p>A shattered green vine<br>
        spilling its wine.<br>
        I eat the shards,<br>
        use them to cut out my heart.</p>
        
        <p>I hold it aloft before the gods.<br>
        It beats its wings like a dove.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Sound Like Sleep</h2>
        
        <p>The wind shakes the trees in sobbing gusts.<br>
        The starlight shatters into falling dust.<br>
        A sound like a sleeper shifting in bed<br>
        rises.  This thread<br>
        unravels.</p>
        
        <p>An untangled web is loosed and travels,<br>
        skittering over the concrete,<br>
        sweeping once lost streets<br>
        until they're emptied.</p>
        
        <p>Dead seeds<br>
        awaken and burst.<br>
        A mad thirst<br>
        trembles in the throat<br>
        that only knows this one note,<br>
        singing its malison.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe I'll sing along, just this once.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Angle</h2>
        
        <p>So casual in that red leather chair,<br>
        the smoke scatters with a tortured air<br>
        as he taps his cigar,<br>
        the ash falls like a thick scar<br>
        sliding from a glowing wound.</p>
        
        <p>A stillness in this seething room...<br>
        He makes a gesture, a ripple of his hand.<br>
        What to make of this man?</p>
        
        <p>Something collapses beyond the wall.</p>
        
        <p>I can feel the crawl<br>
        of my hands as they spider<br>
        along the wood.  Tighter<br>
        and tighter, they strangle<br>
        the place I sit.  An angle</p>
        
        <p>I throw between us<br>
        could be what<br>
        saves me in the end<br>
        but where will I be then?</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Fall</h2>
        
        <p>Something was aflutter,<br>
        wings beaten by the gutter,<br>
        crumpled and thrown away.</p>
        
        <p>I saw you flailing in the wind one day,<br>
        whispering when you touched the ground,<br>
        and I thought to myself, what now?</p>
        
        <p>I could barely make you out<br>
        over this new sound<br>
        and you were dirty in your<br>
        tarantella, smudged and impure.</p>
        
        <p>You had sold all that was left<br>
        and you were twisted into a dress<br>
        that was far too small.</p>
        
        <p>Oh, how the mighty do fall.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>In the Orchard</h2>
        
        <p>The cold white burn of stars<br>
        flecks the sky like sugar,<br>
        the cold white softness<br>
        soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>The white earth of the grave.</p>
        
        <p>White sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>White snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        by a crystalline brook<br>
        that's laughing over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
         
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing,<br>
        like a scream.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Remnants of Autumn</h2>
        
        <p>Autumn corn of autumn leaves<br>
        in orange and red and yellow.</p>
        
        <p>Vernal leaves drift in the wind<br>
        like white icebergs on the sea.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed, as always, in black,<br>
        I walk through this storm of leaves<br>
        until the soft warm rain subsides<br>
        and I find a clear little waterfall<br>
        formed of crooked silver-grey rock,<br>
        like a moon directing the warm waters.</p>
        
        <p>The moon shines<br>
        over a black stretch of forests<br>
        and snow white as the moon.</p>
        
        <p>The bark is black<br>
        as with a burning<br>
        and caked with snow<br>
        like white gauze.</p>
        
        <p>Burned by the fiery colors of autumn,<br>
        the fields are ablaze with indian corn.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Many Darknesses</h2>
        
        <p>A dark street curves upward<br>
        through the night,<br>
        drenched in loneliness.</p>
        
        <p>Peach-colored streetlamps<br>
        burn alone in the emptiness.</p>
        
        <p>A yellow candle burns<br>
        behind the dark pane<br>
        of a window.</p>
        
        <p>I put my palm to the cool glass<br>
        then rest my head there as if to sleep<br>
        and now I sit with my head resting in my hand,<br>
        weeping, at the brown table<br>
        upon which the candle sits.</p>
        
        <p>A candle burns<br>
        in a red glass<br>
        bloodying a bedroom<br>
        with a doleful light.</p>
        
        <p>I stare at the red sunset on the horizon<br>
        through a sliding glass door<br>
        over the shapes of black-green conifers.</p>
        
        <p>Night falls deep and blue.</p>
        
        <p>A black chandelier<br>
        is dimmed to eerie embers.</p>
        
        <p>Darkness waits in an open door.<br>
        The door slams closed on its own.</p>
        
        <p>An old wooden gate<br>
        swings back and forth<br>
        for no reason.</p>
        
        <p>A pale blue flash of lightning<br>
        reveals a child<br>
        standing in the middle of the night<br>
        clutching a doll.</p>
        
        <p>She has pale skin<br>
        and she stares at me<br>
        with her black irises.</p>
        
        <p>At that moment, everything ends.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Insensate</h2>
        
        <p>An arching black-streaked gate<br>
        protects a solid darkness.</p>
        
        <p>Massive dark tree trunks<br>
        huddle together,<br>
        whispering.</p>
        
        <p>Water drips<br>
        from the stalagtites<br>
        onto dark<br>
        subterranean pools.</p>
        
        <p>Someone stands silhouetted<br>
        in the entrance to the cave.</p>
        
        <p>He's staring at me<br>
        through slits of light.</p>
        
        <p>A torch burns<br>
        in a sconce<br>
        with a crayon fire.</p>
        
        <p>Up ahead the path divides,<br>
        each choice unappealing.</p>
        
        <p>A square of light<br>
        floats through<br>
        an abandoned room.</p>
        
        <p>Gossamer curtains<br>
        move in an unfelt wind.</p>
        
        <p>Insensate.</p>
