        <h2>Invocation</h2>
        
        <p>Yahweh Allah Jesus Ahura Mazda Eris<br>
        reclining on the pages of a book,<br>
        you look like the night sky,<br>
        as cold as the Absolute.<br>
        Bring me your emptiness<br>
        so that I may be free.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Foundlings</h2>
        
        <p>The night is dark<br>
        and there is nothing in the sky.</p>
        
        <p>There is a cold in the heights.<br>
        A frozen tarn<br>
        lays impassive on the peak<br>
        and a brutal wind does sweep<br>
        across the meadows,<br>
        crackling among the broken snow.</p>
        
        <p>Flames shiver in a ring of stone<br>
        and a foundling trembles<br>
        in a quaking dance,<br>
        hearkening to the freezing chant<br>
        of the night's syllables of snow<br>
        that not so much resemble<br>
        as suggest the clouds<br>
        smeared across the blue tableau<br>
        some hours ago<br>
        before he reached out and stole<br>
        those sparks from the night,<br>
        before the stars grew unwilling,<br>
        when he could still see<br>
        those pale inkblots in the sky.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Hobbyhorse</h2>
        
        <p>The bones of the beast<br>
        have cracked and split,<br>
        breaking apart in the line,<br>
        its inertia running out<br>
        in the petrified pines,<br>
        as the teeth of drought<br>
        are bleaching into white.</p>
        
        <p>The salt of the sea<br>
        has risen and fallen,<br>
        burning out in the sun,<br>
        the sand sweeping past<br>
        where a river did run,<br>
        where cowboys are riding fast,<br>
        firing their wooden guns.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Crossing</h2>
        
        <p>Cold white bars<br>
        of light slide<br>
        through the dark<br>
        as the wind rattles<br>
        a closing note.</p>
        
        <p>The sun shatters<br>
        in the sea's engulfing throat,<br>
        the result<br>
        of unstoppable decline.</p>
        
        <p>The sea's lumbering strides<br>
        propel it to the mark<br>
        and it lifts a stealthy hand<br>
        to scribble in a cursive pen<br>
        on the disappearing land.</p>
        
        <p>The distance<br>
        between coasts<br>
        grows thin.</p>
        
        <p>Foaming ghosts<br>
        breach the ocean.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Cage's Lost Symphony</h2>
        
        <p>The room is a white hand<br>
        holding a bird of smoke<br>
        whose body billows forth<br>
        in the sharp staccato<br>
        of a vibrating laugh.<br>
        Drops of wine pound<br>
        below the beat of forks<br>
        on fine china drums.</p>
        
        <p>The sky holds a smoking gun<br>
        and a fog grips the fence,<br>
        its fingers twisted around<br>
        the chain's metal throat<br>
        in a rattling ascent.<br>
        Drops of rust fleck the street<br>
        and somewhere a dying machine<br>
        screeches its final note.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Unearthed</h2>
        
        <p>His flashlight waves<br>
        its wand of light<br>
        above the crowd of pine<br>
        that creaks in applause<br>
        at his every step<br>
        on the dusty stage.</p>
        
        <p>The emptiness thrusts<br>
        its swords of dark<br>
        through illusion's heart<br>
        as a curtain drops<br>
        inside his chest<br>
        before a crowd of blood.</p>
        
        <p>Slowly the umbra<br>
        of a burning wick<br>
        draws with its shade,<br>
        and now a stain<br>
        creeps along<br>
        the empty canvas.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly the rust<br>
        of unending nights<br>
        explodes with a crack,<br>
        and somewhere a clap<br>
        resounds beyond<br>
        the sweeping light.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Tenders of the Garden</h2>
        
        <p>Roses explode in the storm<br>
        as the wind whips<br>
        the bloodless garden<br>
        into a hazard of thorns.</p>
        
        <p>Gray clouds fulminate,<br>
        convulsing the sky,<br>
        winds flailing<br>
        as the skin is ripped.</p>
        
        <p>Lightning veins the night,<br>
        throbbing in darkness,<br>
        as the rain pulses.<br>
        Its falling seeds germinate<br>
        in the wailing<br>
        of the wind.</p>
        
        <p>Slipping on the wet stone,<br>
        they cut through the brush,<br>
        seeking a feeble shelter.</p>
        
        <p>From behind the hedgerow<br>
        the moon chances a look<br>
        and the night trembles.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Spindrift</h2>
        
        <p>The moon falls<br>
        like a silver hook,<br>
        sinking through the night,<br>
        exploding on the surface<br>
        and falling back<br>
        in limp strings of light.</p>
        
        <p>A line is carelessly cast<br>
        in the sea's blue scrawl.<br>
        The tool bends its gentle crook<br>
        and turns its<br>
        eye upon itself.</p>
        
        <p>The vessel groans and shifts,<br>
        restless in the waves,<br>
        as the line is sent,<br>
        grasping, into the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Far below something awaits<br>
        and the line jumps with a start.<br>
        The sea whitens<br>
        in the moon's mad grip<br>
        and a man shivers on his boat.<br>
        The sea's grip tightens<br>
        and he disappears down its throat.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Beginning of Night</h2>
        
        <p>Words are throbbing in the light.<br>
        Grinding gears are shaking,<br>
        rattling in the wind.<br>
        They're humming the lines<br>
        the keys are playing<br>
        as they chatter<br>
        in the cold.</p>
        
        <p>Fog is billowing<br>
        as the light changes<br>
        and the fool dances<br>
        before his mic.</p>
        
        <p>The light shatters<br>
        in its strobing,<br>
        the bits<br>
        falling in the crowd.<br>
        In the front row<br>
        a zealot rages,<br>
        grasping after the damaged<br>
        and twisted lights,<br>
        while, from the stage,<br>
        a laughter sounds<br>
        at this ending of days.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Turning of Keys</h2>
        
        <p>Bars of light are sliding<br>
        through the trees.<br>
        Leaves are rippling<br>
        on the branch<br>
        like the turning of keys.</p>
        
        <p>A car is writing<br>
        a tale of roads<br>
        in long, lazy curves.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn bursts like a match,<br>
        sets the trees smoldering,<br>
        ash falling as the leaves burn.<br>
        The wind blows<br>
        a few puffs of smoke<br>
        into the last bit of sky.</p>
        
        <p>A candle is sitting,<br>
        flickering,<br>
        in an orange sun,<br>
        smiling at the streets below.</p>
        
        <p>The moon rides into the night.<br>
        You can almost hear those engines hum.</p>
        <br>



        <h2>Broken</h2>
        
        <p>Clouds bubbled in the sky<br>
        as sunlight poured down<br>
        into the clear day.</p>
        
        <p>Light laughter<br>
        like glasses arose<br>
        as teeth clinked.</p>
        
        <p>In the sunlight<br>
        eyes rapidly blinked,<br>
        devouring the glare.</p>
        
        <p>The weird play<br>
        of dancing trash<br>
        stumbled down the road<br>
        in a gust of air.</p>
        
        <p>A face shattered,<br>
        wide open,<br>
        with a crack<br>
        and any bonds or vows<br>
        were neatly broken.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Turning On</h2>
        
        <p>The earth turns<br>
        its eye to the sun<br>
        as it spins its way<br>
        through the night.</p>
        
        <p>A dervish's trail<br>
        unfurls<br>
        in sandy lines<br>
        and candles wink<br>
        at the sight.</p>
        
        <p>A puff<br>
        of dust whirls<br>
        through the temple<br>
        of the night<br>
        and settles<br>
        in blinking signs<br>
        and eyefuls of sleep.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ex Nihilo</h2>
        
        <p>From the dark abyss<br>
        a line<br>
        of light<br>
        erupts.<br>
        In the simple<br>
        hunger of emptiness<br>
        it grows serpentine,<br>
        bending itself,<br>
        coiling,<br>
        the glint<br>
        of stars<br>
        exploding on its back.</p>
        
        <p>A spring lunges,<br>
        dark earth bursting apart<br>
        as it swells.</p>
        
        <p>The needless<br>
        blossom is cracked.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Patient Sky</h2>
        
        <p>The flower opens its eye,<br>
        lids unfurling,<br>
        and the fruit of the earth<br>
        drips onto the soil.</p>
        
        <p>The liberation of decay<br>
        disintegrates its rind,<br>
        like great towers turning<br>
        to sand in the unending surge<br>
        of the patient sky,<br>
        with the thankless toil<br>
        and unceasing work<br>
        of bitter days.</p>
        
        <p>The nights are growing festive<br>
        and the winter's flurries deep.</p>
        
        <p>Ships are growing restless<br>
        as they bob in the distilling seas.</p>
        
        <p>The winds are taken to screaming...<br>
        and to the sowing of seeds.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Passing Through</h2>
        
        <p>The night<br>
        swings its bat<br>
        at an orange sun<br>
        and it shatters<br>
        into twilight.<br>
        Seeds of light<br>
        are scattered<br>
        across the sky<br>
        as the darkness runs.</p>
        
        <p>Behind its mask<br>
        a ghost pursues<br>
        the night<br>
        as the winds<br>
        pass through<br>
        the dark.</p>
        
        <p>Torn from their husk<br>
        the stars fly free,<br>
        hurtling through space.</p>
        
        <p>The ghost caresses its new face<br>
        and, though by night winds unmoved,<br>
        the garb<br>
        it wears is unwinding<br>
        like the fading of the mist<br>
        in the risen sun.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Quiet Song</h2>
        
        <p>The sky waves<br>
        its banner,<br>
        it whips in the wind,<br>
        and light rain<br>
        sounds a march<br>
        across the damp earth.</p>
        
        <p>With a spark<br>
        the storm's rapid fuse<br>
        is ablaze.<br>
        The daylight explodes<br>
        with a crash,<br>
        metal contorting<br>
        through the sky.</p>
        
        <p>In the haze<br>
        twisted wreckage looms<br>
        and settles<br>
        in a slow collapse.</p>
        
        <p>The storm seems<br>
        to give up,<br>
        loosen its tight grasp<br>
        on the rain<br>
        and the light.<br>
        The sound of its drums<br>
        has run thin.</p>
        
        <p>A white flag<br>
        ripples in the sky<br>
        and is gone<br>
        leaving just the wind<br>
        blowing through<br>
        the clear blue<br>
        with its quiet song.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Lasting But a Moment...</h2>
        
        <p>The sun has fallen<br>
        and the day's funeral<br>
        has begun,<br>
        lowering its coffin<br>
        into the earth. The<br>
        sky grows dark<br>
        with mourning.</p>
        
        <p>Wine sloshes into place<br>
        before the glasses have risen<br>
        in their toasting,<br>
        flashing with dull sparks<br>
        in the flickering light.</p>
        
        <p>The crickets are singing<br>
        in the tittering night<br>
        and the stars do shake<br>
        with laughter.</p>
        
        <p>Lights are winking<br>
        in the hereafter.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Mapmaker</h2>
        
        <p>The sky writes<br>
        a cryptic scrawl<br>
        across the erg<br>
        in crescents of sand&mdash;<br>
        a cypher to peruse<br>
        found in the sickle<br>
        of the wind<br>
        and the remains<br>
        it leaves behind.</p>
        
        <p>Like an iceberg<br>
        adrift on the deep<br>
        a ruin floats on grains<br>
        of dirt tossed about<br>
        by mercurial, fickle<br>
        winds in this arid land&mdash;<br>
        an abandoned keep<br>
        surrendered to the sky<br>
        in a sandy fall.</p>
        
        <p>Dusty soldiers are lined<br>
        up on the stony front<br>
        as the sky fights<br>
        with its forces pinned<br>
        against a broken redoubt.</p>
        
        <p>A squawk comes over the cable<br>
        inspiring a ruthless hunt<br>
        as the general turns his eye<br>
        to the maps on his table<br>
        in search of further clues.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Taming the Sky</h2>
        
        <p>The moon's white hand<br>
        rises into the sky.<br>
        The stars tremble<br>
        in a dying of the light.</p>
        
        <p>Pale spiders skitter<br>
        across the skin of the night<br>
        before the first blush of dawn.<br>
        The jaundiced sky withers<br>
        at its bleeding horizon.</p>
        
        <p>A song<br>
        rises inside the temple<br>
        from the mouth<br>
        of an eclipsed sun<br>
        and resounds<br>
        in the bright crash<br>
        of an echoing<br>
        gong.</p>
        
        <p>A tamed lion's<br>
        roaring<br>
        settles down<br>
        in the mist of<br>

        <p>Clouds outline the morning,<br>
        tracing the body of the sky,<br>
        but cannot staunch<br>
        the surging dawn.</p>
        
        <p>The stain<br>
        of light<br>
        spreads<br>
        but the<br>
        stars die<br>
        slowly.</p>
        
        <p>The earth is placed<br>
        in a frame<br>
        of parched skies.</p>
        
        <p>The shadowy tread<br>
        of night<br>
        steps on bones,<br>
        with the boots<br>
        of the<br>
        wondering mob.</p>
        
        <p>The lost cogs<br>
        of a creaking<br>
        subterfuge<br>
        are rolling<br>
        across the sky<br>
        and its face<br>
        is bleeding.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Guest</h2>
        
        <p>Crouching in its<br>
        disheveled yard,<br>
        it bows to the wind,<br>
        murmuring an obsequity<br>
        in creaking timber.</p>
        
        <p>Wrinkles of<br>
        failing paint<br>
        marble its skin,<br>
        and fall apart:<br>
        a trickling<br>
        of stars,<br>
        as constellations<br>
        undo themselves.</p>
        
        <p>Bricks pulled from<br>
        the foundation<br>
        lie beneath windows<br>
        that wait to be broken.<br>
        Wielding its bones,<br>
        a vandal will deface<br>
        the fragile skin,<br>
        now that it's thinner.</p>
        
        <p>Its door swings open<br>
        in a polite gesture<br>
        of invitation<br>
        to the weather.</p>
        
        <p>The rope lies broken<br>
        in the forgotten well.</p>

        <h2>The Sun Is Setting</h2>
        
        <p>Birds squawk<br>
        in a jagged dance<br>
        of sharpened angles<br>
        in a fog-filled marsh,<br>
        cloudy forms writhing<br>
        in a vague discourse.</p>
        
        <p>The sewers whisper<br>
        to the streets<br>
        in a breath of steam<br>
        where the modern talk<br>
        of the kidnapped<br>
        is enslaved to vandals<br>
        in a scrawl of the dying.</p>
        
        <p>This litter,<br>
        this hard<br>

        <h2>The Beating of Wings</h2>
        
        <p>Just one small slip and<br>
        a green vine is shattering,<br>
        spraying drunken blood</p>
        
        <p>across the witchgrass.<br>
        Provoked by this injury<br>
        a deep momentum</p>
        
        <p>takes me by the hand,<br>
        grabs hold of the jagged leaves,<br>
        liberates my heart</p>
        
        <p>from its dark crevasse.<br>
        Inside, the red baptistry<br>
        drips with the high art</p>
        
        <p>of this sacrifice.<br>
        My heart, finally unstuck,<br>
        flutters with freedom</p>
        
        <p>and begins to rise.<br>
        It beats its wings like a dove,<br>
        flapping only once.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Vacant Ground</h2>
        
        <p>Quickly starlight dust<br>
        vanishes in a white puff<br>
        of darkling magic.</p>
        
        <p>As the plot blackens,<br>
        slowly a thread unravels<br>
        in the blind vandal's</p>
        
        <p>blood. Crimson trolleys<br>
        clatter, sweeping the lost streets<br>
        until they're empty.</p>
        
        <p>Vacant ground: dead seeds<br>
        shift, stir, awaken, and burst<br>
        in arid splendor.</p>
        
        <p>And now a mad thirst<br>
        is trembling in the throat,<br>
        singing its one note,</p>
        
        <p>ringing forever,<br>
        the sound of the unanswered<br>
        finally shattered.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Angle</h2>
        
        <p>Massing on the east edge<br>
        of the chair, a smokiness<br>
        flanks a battered cigar.<br>
        Ash falls like a thick scar<br>
        sliding from a glowing wound<br>
        when he but barely moves.</p>
        
        <p>His chair offers a plea<br>
        and I hear something<br>
        collapse beyond the wall.</p>
        
        <p>Ice drops into the alcohol,<br>
        a celestial body disappearing<br>
        into that small clear sea.<br>
        Pounding walls of melted sand,<br>
        it cracks its frozen hands<br>
        on an invisible prison.</p>
        
        <p>My hands grip the glassy finish<br>
        of these two broken arms,<br>
        knotted in wooden scars<br>
        like little pine glyphs,<br>
        as I strangle the place I sit.</p>
        
        <p>What has the keenness<br>
        to scar the flat cement<br>
        of the dried brick heart<br>
        of a man this parched?<br>
        What tortured sestina<br>
        can I throw between us?<br>
        What repetition can refute<br>
        the refrains of bleak truth<br>
        that a loaded gun speaks?</p>

        <h2>The Dark Fiber</h2>
        
        <p>A splash of white wings<br>
        ripples the blacktop river<br>
        as a scribble of dark water<br>
        crosses the stunted pages.</p>
        
        <p>Fingers of black sewage<br>
        turn whispering pages<br>
        as the storm rocks<br>
        in its splashing chair.</p>
        
        <p>The treadstone hisses<br>
        its rolling headlines<br>
        then suddenly swerves<br>
        to pick up the news<br>
        with splashing hands.</p>
        
        <p>The paper rips apart<br>
        like an exploding star,<br>
        shattering under<br>
        the undercarriage,<br>
        as headlights flicker,</p>
        
        <p>lighting up</p>
        
        <p>the dark fiber</p>

        <p>...that's when they spoke<br>
        of the curse of the temple,<br>
        and of how the obscene<br>
        must lie forever unknown,<br>
        of the law of the kings.</p>
        
        <p>The sun had fallen<br>
        and the workers fled,<br>
        and wordless scribes<br>
        had dropped their pens<br>
        to claw the sand instead.</p>
        
        <p>The night was yellow<br>
        with the unsettled<br>
        dust of this blasphemy<br>
        and the incandescents<br>
        flickered uncertainly.</p>
        
        <p>The day's frail ghost<br>
        shakes all the bones<br>
        that it possesses<br>
        to lose the unforgotten<br>
        in a macabre procession.</p>

        <h2>Valet Parking</h2>
        
        <p>The valets are massing<br>
        as the night throws cars<br>
        in thin black lines<br>
        of calligrapher's art,<br>
        and they're sighing<br>
        across pages of night.</p>
        
        <p>Like a pendant dancing<br>
        in her decolletage,<br>
        a new suit-and-tie<br>
        swings from her arm,<br>
        his teeth trying<br>
        to catch the light.</p>
        
        <p>Random muses hatching<br>
        from the restaurant<br>
        crack the doors at nine.<br>
        Men signal for their cars<br>
        while valets are busy rifling<br>
        through the contents of the ride.</p>

        <h2>Hunger</h2>
        
        <p>The cars are slouching<br>
        to the city's jaundiced beat<br>
        of acrylic cuts.</p>
        
        <p>The sweet rose's sound<br>
        accents the wafting tongues<br>
        of billboard preachers.</p>
        
        <p>Here at the crossroads,<br>
        sour apples tempt the shrunken,<br>
        who no longer reach.</p>
        
        <p>The lotus blossom<br>
        flickers open on the screen,<br>
        and it sings of lust.</p>
        
        <p>The sleepwalkers step<br>
        into the mouths of their gowns,<br>
        mumbling bedtime tales.</p>
        
        <p>Here, where the world ends,<br>
        unwounded dragons awake<br>
        the devourer.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Courtship</h2>
        
        <p>He serenades the sky,<br>
        in romantic despair,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        
        <p>When her gray beauty strides<br>
        across the blue barrens,<br>
        he serenades the sky.</p>
        
        <p>He praises her unkindness<br>
        with his songs of swearing,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        
        <p>When she roars with violence<br>
        and her tears are harrowing,<br>
        he serenades the sky.</p>
        
        <p>He watches the storm subside,<br>
        finds himself not caring,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        
        <p>When the winds fall silent,<br>
        he plays a mournful air.<br>
        He serenades the sky,<br>
        and the wind is sighing.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Drifting Away</h2>
        
        <p>My skin is rended<br>
        by the sun's convulsing light<br>
        as spring comes thrusting<br>
        forth with a rustling cry<br>
        and into my empty limbs.</p>
        
        <p>As summer ascends,<br>
        red flames burn on my branches<br>
        with their drooling tongues<br>
        until they're full on my sap<br>
        and leave in a steady dripping.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn is subtle,<br>
        and I am slowly bereaved<br>
        as it works in stealth,<br>
        leaves drifting off in the breeze<br>
        as they're seduced by the wind.</p>
        
        <p>In long sobbing gusts,<br>
        my naked limbs are shaking<br>
        when winter descends<br>
        its delicate spiral case,<br>
        bringing my last visitor.</p>

        <h2>In the Orchard</h2>
        
        <p>The burning of stars flecks<br>
        the sky like spilled sugar,<br>
        the cold white light<br>
        as soft as a blanket.</p>
        
        <p>There is white earth on the grave.</p>
        
        <p>There are white sheets on the bed.</p>
        
        <p>There is white snow in the cornfield.</p>
        
        <p>A dark and tattered tree<br>
        sits by a crystalline brook<br>
        that laughs over the stones.</p>
        
        <p>Autumn cries with its trees<br>
        and shakes in sobbing gusts.</p>
        
        <p>The leaves rustle in the wind<br>
        like a sleeper shifting in bed.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed in mourning black<br>
        I walk through the orchard<br>
        among the heavy gusts of leaves<br>
        in November's orange light,<br>
        which is like a warm apple cider,<br>
        waiting for the apples to bloom,<br>
        to blossom out of nothing<br>
        like a scream.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ablaze</h2>
        
        <p>The autumn winds dance<br>
        in their dress of maize.</p>
        
        <p>Green icebergs drift<br>
        on a sea of spring.</p>
        
        <p>Dressed in black<br>
        I slide through<br>
        the storm of leaves<br>
        until its soft<br>
        rain subsides<br>
        and I find a<br>
        little waterfall<br>
        rolling across<br>
        silver-gray rock<br>
        like a moon<br>
        directing the<br>
        warm waters.</p>
        
        <p>The moon shines<br>
        over a black stretch<br>
        of forests covered<br>
        with lunar snow.</p>
        
        <p>The bark is black<br>
        as with a burning<br>
        and caked with snow<br>
        like white gauze.</p>
        
        <p>Burning in the<br>
        autumnal light,<br>
        the fields blaze<br>
        with Indian corn.</p>

        <h2>Darkness Waits</h2>
        
        <p>A black street curves<br>
        through an empty night.<br>
        Peaches smolder<br>
        their cold light<br>
        across the asphalt.</p>
        
        <p>A yellow candle burns<br>
        behind the dark pane<br>
        of a window.</p>
        
        <p>I put my palm<br>
        to the cool glass<br>
        then rest my head<br>
        as if to sleep<br>
        and now I cry<br>
        at the brown table<br>
        upon which the candle sits.</p>
        
        <p>A candle burns<br>
        in a red glass<br>
        bloodying a bedroom<br>
        with a doleful light.</p>
        
        <p>Night spreads its deep blue<br>
        upon the brown horizon.</p>
        
        <p>A black chandelier<br>
        quiets its shaking embers.</p>
        
        <p>Darkness waits<br>
        in an open door.<br>
        The door closes.</p>
        
        <p>An old wooden gate<br>
        swings back and forth<br>
        in the dying yard.</p>
        
        <p>A pale blue flash of lightning<br>
        reveals a child<br>
        standing in the middle of the night<br>
        clutching a doll.</p>
        
        <p>She has pale skin<br>
        and she stares at me<br>
        with her black irises.</p>
        
        <p>At that moment<br>

        <p>Massive dark tree trunks<br>
        huddle together,<br>
        whispering.</p>
        
        <p>Water drips<br>
        from the stalagtites<br>
        onto dark<br>
        subterranean pools.</p>
        
        <p>Someone stands silhouetted<br>
        in the entrance to the cave.</p>
        
        <p>He's staring at me<br>
        through slits of light.</p>
        
        <p>A torch burns<br>
        in a sconce<br>
        with a crayon fire.</p>
        
        <p>Up ahead the path divides,<br>
        each choice unappealing.</p>
        
        <p>A square of light<br>
        floats through<br>
        an abandoned room.</p>
        
        <p>Gossamer curtains<br>
        move in an unfelt wind.</p>

        <p>A blind is closed<br>

        The window is a square<br>
        of dark blue.</p>
        
        <p>A wash of light<br>
        courses through<br>
        the night. A comet...</p>
        
        <p>In the dark distance<br>
        a faint light illuminates.</p>
        
        <p>I am looking<br>

        of a zen garden<br>
        filled with pebbles.</p>
        
        <p>I am struck<br>
        by the fear<br>
        of memory.<br>
        I can go<br>
        no further.</p>

        <h2>Away, Into, Away</h2>
        
        <p>In the chill blue air<br>
        a purple flower<br>
        peels itself open,<br>
        stretching until<br>
        its petals fall away.</p>
        
        <p>One of them spirals<br>
        through a vast,<br>
        roaring emptiness<br>
        until it's frozen<br>
        in a block of ice.</p>
        
        <p>A naked woman in a blue room,<br>
        filled with silence and water,<br>
        strides down flooded stairs<br>
        into the cold embrace<br>
        of a freezing pool,<br>
        a small smile floating<br>
        to the surface of her face.</p>
        
        <p>In the burning yellow air,<br>
        a woman closes her book<br>
        and rises to her feet.<br>
        She tosses her book<br>
        into the pool<br>
        as she walks away.<br>
        It goes quietly<br>
        into the water,<br>
        its pages still dry.</p>

        <h2>Against the Silence</h2>
        
        <p>A gold crown rests<br>
        on a cushion of night.<br>
        A soft whispering<br>
        in the dark.</p>
        
        <p>The wind is gentle<br>
        in the green leaves<br>
        of a murmuring forest.</p>
        
        <p>Coins are falling<br>
        in a quiet rain,<br>
        soaking velvet.</p>
        
        <p>A man moves through<br>
        a faint blue storm,<br>
        hard footsteps<br>
        on cold asphalt.</p>
        
        <p>A car keeps driving<br>
        on through the dark,<br>
        lit by dirty yellow light.<br>
        The tires' low growl<br>
        yelps to a stop.</p>
        
        <p>An empty house,<br>
        its cold panels flat<br>
        against the silence.<br>
        Welcome home.</p>

        <p>The air is cool and still:<br>
        white streaks in blue marble.<br>
        Crickets are singing offstage.</p>
        
        <p>A bush waves in greeting<br>
        with its dusty green hand<br>
        while it whispers something<br>
        in your ear.</p>
        
        <p>A coarse path lies before you,<br>
        graying into the cold distance.<br>
        Your steps are hungry<br>
        and they crunch the miles,<br>
        with the mouth of the garden open.</p>
        
        <p>A burgundy flower is there,<br>
        the thorns daring you<br>
        to pick up the glass,<br>
        to know the taste<br>
        you'll never have.</p>
        
        <p>Sapphire burns in the sky;<br>
        sounds like a shattering,<br>
        tastes like glass: sweet.</p>
        
        <p>Don't you think it's time<br>
        you closed your eyes?</p>

        <p>The clouds are sighing<br>
        and the wind is soaked<br>
        in the storm's flat grey.</p>
        
        <p>The rain stumbles,<br>
        tripping on salted earth,<br>
        collapsing into silt seas.</p>
        
        <p>The waves scribble<br>
        on the blank tides<br>
        with their blue pen<br>
        until the ink runs low.</p>
        
        <p>The ground is erased<br>
        in whispering strokes<br>
        of grey debris.</p>
        
        <p>The world's<br>
        demoralized breath<br>
        shuffles by,<br>

        from nothingness.</p>
        
        <p>I walk a brisk pace<br>
        down nonexistent paths.<br>
        The bones of sloths<br>

        <p>The house of deformity<br>
        looks so peaceful tonight<br>
        sitting in the darkness.<br>
        But those doors open onto<br>
        a horrifying realm of infinite</p>
        
        <p>obscenity with a maelstrom<br>
        of boundless corruption<br>
        contorting in the center<br>
        in a howling slipstream<br>
        glowing with a wet sheen.</p>
        
        <p>As I creak the doors open,<br>
        I feel the darkness deepen,<br>
        moving in a crimson slither<br>
        through my quickening blood.<br>
        Through the screaming ether</p>
        
        <p>a familiar voice reverberates<br>
        the words of distorted rites<br>
        that sound ancient and foreign,<br>
        a voice I'm hear to murder.<br>
        Into my wrist, I carve a rune</p>
        
        <p>of the most perfect uniformity,<br>
        and raise my flowing stigmata<br>
        far above my reeling head.<br>
        Before me, I see a face ashen<br>
        as it stares at its reflection.</p>

        The indescribable scent<br>
        of dangerous chemicals</p>
        
        <p>rises from the machinery<br>
        to rest on your tongue<br>
        with the effect of glue<br>
        as you try to open wide,<br>
        finding your voice absent.<br>
        You can hear the calls</p>
        
        <p>of glass, voices airy<br>
        as they're asphyxiating.<br>
        Their insides are aglow<br>
        with a thickening fluid,<br>
        one last bubbling descent<br>

        flicker like candelabras<br>
        swaying in their windy daze.</p>
        
        <p>With every shift of wind<br>
        they unresistingly curve<br>
        into the shape of force.</p>
        
        <p>They twist and they unwind<br>
        contorting something fierce<br>
        as they painfully carve</p>
        
        <p>the newest demanded shape<br>
        from their breaking fibers<br>
        in a strange unravelling.</p>
        
        <p>Such fine craftsmanship!<br>
        The shapes are enthralling<br>

        toward the gods of blind fate,<br>
        a parasol twirls across the sun.</p>
        
        <p>This act of stellar arson<br>
        grows dark in the firefight,<br>
        and now nothing can be seen.</p>
        
        <p>As terror drives you insane<br>
        and your thoughts are forfeit,<br>
        a parasol twirls across the sun.</p>
        
        <p>Dying flames sigh in unison<br>
        in a long smokeless defeat<br>
        and now nothing can be seen.</p>
        
        <p>After the sun's burning lesson,<br>
        you can hear the night refute.<br>
        A parasol twirls across the sun<br>

        He is casting a dark malison<br>
        as he stares into a mirror.</p>
        
        <p>In the circle stands a mammoth<br>
        figure with eyes that smolder<br>
        with lies. A smoking artifice<br>
        sneaks out of the trapdoor<br>
        of his voice. "It's your career</p>
        
        <p>that's at stake," he says.<br>
        "Finish what you've started.<br>
        Now give your name to me<br>
        and enter into my servitude."<br>
        He couldn't stand to pause,</p>
        
        <p>to endure this yearning. Seize<br>
        the day! Fame is in that fire!<br>
        And the real enemy here is time.<br>

        the floodlights start dimming<br>
        to the darkness of a Locrian mode.</p>
        
        <p>Atop the tower, the static hisses<br>
        as the last of the chords resolves.</p>
        
        <p>The dying weather slowly rotates<br>
        around the shivering roustabout.<br>
        Below, the barrens are brimming<br>
        as the hard red land is remade<br>
        into the most violent of seas.</p>
        
        <p>The last bit of earth dissolves<br>
        as he looks down and hesitates.</p>
        
        <p>He kneels as if in tribute<br>
        to a storm of his dreaming,<br>
        one that left him a nomad,<br>
        one with no more chances.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Open Book</h2>
        
        <p>The clouds are growing dark<br>
        with a broken promise of rain.<br>
        The earth below is cracked<br>
        and this world of withering<br>
        crunches underfoot like jaws<br>
        grinding in a sleeper's mouth.</p>
        
        <p>The wind will carve with its dirk<br>
        as it draws the summoner's rune<br>
        where once the storm crooked<br>
        the land with its weathering,<br>
        when the land's broken pages<br>
        were the playground of myth,<br>
        when the ink was still black<br>
        where the arcane letters ran,<br>
        when the book never creaked,<br>
        wasn't noisy with blathering.</p>
        
        <p>But now the book divulges<br>
        nothing with its empty mouth<br>
        and the landscape is bleak.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Prophecy</h2>
        
        <p>In this twisted landscape<br>
        dying trees are growing<br>
        and brown grass chokes<br>
        the fertile soil.</p>
        
        <p>The boiling sky is black<br>
        and it threatens rain<br>
        while a candle of wind<br>
        flickers to and fro.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond its blackboard's scope<br>
        the sky is erratically drawing<br>
        meandering lines with its chalks<br>
        across the walls of the castle,<br>
        walls that will only fray<br>
        once they've been overrun,<br>
        bleeding block by block<br>
        from a grey wound.</p>
        
        <p>Swinging in the bellfry,<br>
        a silent bell is crowing.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Last Storm of the Season</h2>
        
        <p>Cold winds are screaming<br>
        but the world is still,<br>
        untouched, not even trembling.<br>
        The waters are tinted windows,<br>
        a candle is a yellow crayon.<br>
        Everything is solid and hard.</p>
        
        <p>Serrated knives of crystal<br>
        lie frozen and unheard<br>
        in the hands of a tragedian,<br>
        its blue hands scrambling<br>
        as the lights are dimming.</p>
        
        <p>At the call of the clarion<br>
        the weather slowly dies.<br>
        The storm is disassembling<br>
        as the world turns hard.</p>
        
        <p>Slowly comes the end of days,<br>
        slowly as the winds grow still.</p>
        
        <p>And no clocks are chiming.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Arsonist</h2>
        
        <p>Beautiful clouds of smoke<br>
        drift through the blue sky<br>
        and the flames are nodding<br>
        in the wind like a flower.<br>
        Crackling like a snare drum,<br>
        the wood releases embers<br>
        in miniature explosions.</p>
        
        <p>This fire is heartwarming.<br>
        What a wonderful parade.</p>
        
        <p>He slowly dons his smock<br>
        and opens the whiskey.</p>
        
        <p>The fire is budding,<br>
        seemingly from nowhere,<br>
        with the logic of a dream.</p>
        
        <p>Quietly the matchbook gibbers<br>
        in the strangest elisions<br>
        and the fire is fully blooming.</p>
        
        <p>As the words turn florid<br>
        and the soul turns to smoke,<br>
        you can look into the sky<br>
        and the fire is everywhere.<br>
        The beautiful diversions<br>
        all asleep in their chambers...</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Into the Forest</h2>
        
        <p>The prairie is rippling<br>
        in a cool and mild breeze<br>
        like the ocean's fingers<br>
        massaging a tired shore.<br>
        Here and there, trees poke<br>
        their heads out of the grass,<br>
        briefly coming up for air<br>
        before diving back down.</p>
        
        <p>Broken light is dappling<br>
        the grass as it gyres<br>
        where the trees peek<br>
        through a green fissure.</p>
        
        <p>The trees leave a bruise,<br>
        their fingers trampling,<br>
        moving without grace.<br>
        The grass grows sparer<br>
        and the light is undone.</p>
        
        <p>The trees slowly pock<br>
        the prairie as they sheer<br>
        their way through the grass<br>
        and the light grows impurer.</p>
        
        <p>He knows this is no down.<br>
        Once the dark is crippling,<br>
        then he can see his error.</p>
        
        <p>Into the forest, he staggers.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Dictator</h2>
        
        <p>Their frothing mouths are hands,<br>
        and every question is a dagger.<br>
        These robed cowards are skulking,<br>
        cloaking themselves in freedom.</p>
        
        <p>Our napalm will illuminate<br>
        the dark corners where they hide,<br>
        and their paper armor will burn.<br>
        Our tongues will be bayonets.<br>
        We'll speak the words of gore.</p>
        
        <p>The baying of these hounds<br>
        is digging holes in my head.<br>
        Inside them the light is dim<br>
        as their treason derascinates.<br>
        The hunger in their barking<br>
        is insatiable and infinite.</p>
        
        <p>With their lies, they are provoking.<br>
        And with their blood, we are reborn.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Dance of the Victors</h2>
        
        <p>See this ribbon twining,<br>
        whirling around my arm?<br>
        There is a war raging.<br>
        I'm on the losing side.</p>
        
        <p>See this dust-soaked alley,<br>
        the litter blowing through,<br>
        the refuse stumbling along,<br>
        tainted blood of the city?<br>
        We are the writhing worm<br>
        burrowing through the sod.</p>
        
        <p>The streets are blackening<br>
        as the blood is converging,<br>
        coursing through the hollow,<br>
        the emptiness it's ensouling.</p>
        
        <p>The blood cell's plunging<br>
        like a single stone's throw<br>
        in the city's little lotto<br>
        or drops of my burning tallow<br>
        descending, forever falling.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Dive</h2>
        
        <p>He stands there cold and naked,<br>
        shivering before the gelid water.<br>
        Its dark blue surface staring<br>
        at him, looking so uninviting.</p>
        
        <p>What will it be like, the shock<br>
        of the ice as it cocoons him?<br>
        And what dark things lie below<br>
        its surface, slumbering there?</p>
        
        <p>He remembers when the wind cooed<br>
        with a cold that wasn't bitter,<br>
        with a voice that was reassuring<br>
        and whose songs were riveting.</p>
        
        <p>He readies himself with a shake<br>
        as hard as his body will allow.<br>
        He can feel his blood slither<br>
        as his heart works its mayhem.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe the pool will grow whiter,<br>
        the decision will be made for him<br>
        by the icy whims of the weather.<br>
        If he can't dive into the hollow,<br>
        bubbly arches of this ice arcade<br>
        then he's free from discovering<br>
        what's down there quietly waiting<br>
        on the other side of the water.</p>
        
        <p>He's probably still standing there...</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Transmission</h2>
        
        <p>Stormclouds tumble across the sky.<br>
        The future is blowing black smoke<br>
        into the night's starless canopy.<br>
        Its quiet footsteps can be heard<br>
        in the distance as it approaches.<br>
        The chill you feel is its spies<br>
        as they slide invisibly past you.</p>
        
        <p>Inexorably, its steps grow louder<br>
        until their roar becomes seismic.<br>
        Soon the sound will fully occupy<br>
        the atmosphere in quick blanches<br>
        of terror at the oncoming horde.</p>
        
        <p>All you can sense is the audio,<br>
        the harsh signal you suppose<br>
        must be the air gone all askew,<br>
        as the thing reaches the border.</p>
        
        <p>Then the wind gone suddenly hard.</p>
        
        <p>And the clouds an empty smock<br>
        drifting slow and phantasmic.</p>
        
        <p>Then the rain as it drenches.</p>
        
        <p>And the touch on your shoulder,<br>
        the white noise from the stereo.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Healing</h2>
        
        <p>It's a placid shade of blue,<br>
        this thing that fills my vision<br>
        as if it was the sum of being.</p>
        
        <p>And it's a warm shade of blue,<br>
        this thing that fills my pores,<br>
        as if it was an amniotic sea.</p>
        
        <p>It's a quiet whisper of wind,<br>
        this sound that fills my ears<br>
        as if it was my own monologue.</p>
        
        <p>It's a quiet lapping of wind,<br>
        this sound that fills my sigh<br>
        as if it was a nice diversion.</p>
        
        <p>The beauty of this tableau<br>
        and my fear are parleying,<br>
        are in some sort of dialogue.</p>
        
        <p>The silence of this tableau<br>
        and my peace are magnifiers,<br>
        are the serenity that appears.</p>
        
        <p>My lungs are just a wound<br>
        waiting for an infusion<br>
        of the healing sea.</p>
        
        <p>My life is just a wound<br>
        awaiting the conveying<br>
        of the epilogue.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>One with Everything</h2>
        
        <p>It's been raining for days.<br>
        Grey drops are descending<br>
        in those huge blurry waves<br>
        that indistinguish objects.</p>
        
        <p>Everything is drab wetness,<br>
        everything slowly dissolves<br>
        into the fall's white noise<br>
        and into its senseless cold.</p>
        
        <p>The land swirling in eddies<br>
        as the ground is conceding<br>
        to a flood that reweaves<br>
        all into a new wholeness.</p>
        
        <p>With fear, the steeplejacks<br>
        finally resign themselves<br>
        to their drowning destinies,<br>
        being relentlessly encircled<br>
        by the slow, jostling bodies<br>
        of their friends serenading<br>
        them in rainy crescendos<br>
        that fill the damp airwaves<br>
        with their malformed objects.</p>
        
        <p>Perched atop their antennas,<br>
        they slowly steel themselves<br>
        before singing their threnodies,<br>
        songs bright and monotonous.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>The Longest Moment</h2>
        
        <p>The earth is frosted white<br>
        and I exhale a tiny ghost<br>
        in the crackling, icy still.</p>
        
        <p>A clear stream is tumbling over<br>
        a field of round black rocks<br>
        in the quietest murmuring voice.</p>
        
        <p>The distant baying of a hound<br>
        slaps me with its icy palm.</p>
        
        <p>I stumble into the glassy wet<br>
        shattering the quiet crystal<br>
        stream as I slosh upriver.</p>
        
        <p>Just then a low, howling gust<br>
        starts to make me nervous<br>
        with its strange atmospherics.</p>
        
        <p>I empty into my shaking hand<br>
        my last 3 tabs of diazepam.</p>
        
        <p>I jump away from the wet silver<br>
        of the freezing river's steel<br>
        glinting in a slashing hand.</p>
        
        <p>I remember that quiet druggist,<br>
        his face turning winter white,<br>
        rivers flowing from his thorax.</p>
        
        <p>What did I know? I was a novice.<br>
        I had him pegged for a pushover.</p>
        
        <p>Just then the shock of a pistol<br>
        hits me with the icy hysterics<br>
        that only now do I comprehend.</p>
        
        <p>In my soul's dark crevice,<br>
        only now, do I rediscover<br>
        that tiny moment, the longest.</p>
        
        <p>The lifting of a weight,<br>
        the emptiness in my palm.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>A Moral Allegory</h2>
        
        <p>These flames are more beautiful<br>
        than any of the burning canvases,<br>
        the filth on which they feast.</p>
        
        <p>These flames represent freedom:<br>
        freedom from decadence that rusts<br>
        the girders of our great society,<br>
        oxidizing them to flaming orange<br>
        until they collapse around us.</p>
        
        <p>These flames are the artful,<br>
        embodied in crackling verses,<br>
        their beauty made manifest.</p>
        
        <p>These flames are the kingdom,<br>
        the burning crown that arrests<br>
        the strokes of this atrocity,<br>
        whose violent colors derange<br>
        the senses in order to seduce.</p>
        
        <p>These flames are the sound of fall,<br>
        the crackling of broken heresies,<br>
        powder in a red fist.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Inconsequential</h2>
        
        <p>A gentle breeze feathers the air<br>
        and the page is thrust violently<br>
        through the sky's peaceful blue<br>
        that it soaks into a blurry mess.</p>
        
        <p>The wind is forming gentle spirals<br>
        that jostle the page without cease.<br>
        The wind whispers a sweet lullaby<br>
        that drowns out the written word.</p>
        
        <p>The soft blue of the weather<br>
        blurs words into blank cumuli.<br>
        The diffuseness of this tableau<br>
        makes everything turn lachrymose.</p>
        
        <p>Gentle rain fills these pastorals<br>
        with the most scathing exegesis<br>
        and the tiniest cumulonimbi<br>
        scatter everything windward.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Adagio</h2>
        
        <p>Enemies roar,<br>
        mouths distend<br>
        into black pits<br>
        as sound erupts,<br>
        fulminates in<br>
        explosive bodies.</p>
        
        <p>The trumpets<br>
        make their rips<br>
        and the garrison<br>
        slowly glissandos<br>
        into a wound<br>
        of an aria,<br>
        a beautiful roar<br>
        that will astound<br>
        all the puppets<br>
        as it unwraps<br>
        every person<br>
        with its trenodies.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, a woodwind,<br>
        a quiet whisperer,<br>
        in solemn adagio...</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Universal Solvent</h2>
        
        <p>Diving through transparent sky,<br>
        feeling the wind pour over me<br>
        with the sound of ringing glass,<br>
        tumbling in gravity's cradle.</p>
        
        <p>The clouds like spindrift<br>
        in the sloshing atmosphere<br>
        that surrounds my descent<br>
        through this neon twilight.</p>
        
        <p>As the clock grows dusky<br>
        and the sky becomes magma,<br>
        glowing with an amber gloss,<br>
        the wind turns tidal,<br>
        blowing in a lethargic updraft.</p>
        
        <p>Ever so slowly I transfer<br>
        my energy to the fluorescent<br>
        light that begins to coagulate<br>
        in the swirling flask I<br>
        use to peform this alchemy.</p>
        
        <p>The sky like a wineglass,<br>
        the light gone translucent,<br>
        the clouds like a puddle,<br>
        the wind gone pianissimo,<br>
        myself a speck in the light,<br>
        the flaw in a perfect sphere.</p>
        <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>Ode</h2>
        
        <p>Weighed down by dark matter,<br>
        the silver links stretching<br>
        with the bowing of the tray,<br>
        the device is about to break<br>
        or slip from her tired hand.</p>
        
        <p>What she carries in the other<br>
        makes a low whistling sound<br>
        as it slowly moves to and fro,<br>
        ripping an unearthly tear<br>
        with its red, bewitching<br>
        strokes into the fabric<br>
        of the tumultuous ether<br>
        she can no longer comprehend.</p>
        
        <p>Her moves a dark geometry<br>
        in the inky quicksand<br>
        of a doctrinal fray,<br>
        she lays upon the altar<br>
        the last twitching<br>
        sacrifice to bigotry,<br>
        with its single tear,<br>
        working in longhand,<br>
        pens an ode to the Father.</p>
