Invocation

O Sacred Names, O sacred text,
reclining on the pages of a book,
you look like the night sky,
as cold as the Absolute.
Bring me your emptiness
so that I may be free.





I



Foundlings

The night is dark
and there is nothing in the sky.

There is a cold in the heights.
A frozen tarn
lays impassive on the peak
and a brutal wind does sweep
across the meadows,
crackling among the broken snow.

Flames shiver in a ring of stone
and a foundling trembles
in a quaking dance,
hearkening to the freezing chant
of the night's syllables of snow
that not so much resemble
as suggest the clouds
smeared across the blue tableau
some hours ago
before he reached out and stole
those sparks from the night,
before the stars grew unwilling,
when he could still see
those pale inkblots in the sky.



The Hobbyhorse

Bones of ponderosa
rattle in the wind.
Empty pans clatter
in the petrified pines.
The river shatters
as it hits the mines.
The gold is scattered.

The salt of the sea
has risen and fallen,
burning out in the sun,
the sand sweeping past
where a river did run,
where cowboys are riding fast,
firing their wooden guns.



The Crossing

Cold white bars
of light slide
through the dark
as the wind rattles
a closing note.

The sun shatters
in the sea's engulfing throat,
the result
of unstoppable decline.

The sea's lumbering strides
propel it to the mark
and it lifts a stealthy hand
to scribble in a cursive pen
on the disappearing land.

The distance
between coasts
grows thin.

Foaming ghosts
breach the ocean.



Cage's Lost Symphony

I. Largo

The room is a white hand
holding a bird of smoke.
It's lethargic wings flap
like the lips of a soprano.
Staccato sips of Latour
move the undulating reeds
in their melodic contours.
Then light chords of quiche,
forks on fine china drums.

II. Presto

The sky holds a smoking gun
by its burning metal throat,
its lolling tongue now quiet.
Fingers twist pizzicato
around a chainlink fence.
With polyrhythmic drumming
shells tattoo the ground.
Somewhere a dying machine
screeches its final sound.

III. Nullo

The void's frozen fingers
thresh the vibrating stars.
These are frequencies unheard
because the audience departs
before this movement begins,
and these are no longer sounds.
This is not for human senses,
this fading of nebular clouds
in one eternally sustaining

D i m i n u e n d o . . .



Prestidigitation

abandoned venue
curling posters

a chained door
an escape artist

clothing whispers
quiet affirmations

a padlock opens
his heart clicks

an empty stage
a shaking light

his footsteps
muffled applause

dusty footprints
eyes following

address the darkness
witness the illusion

a crowd of blood
heart's drumroll

tapping his heart
his wand of dust

the grand gesture
the misdirection

the gray smoke
vanishing memory

the sudden applause
the missing audience

the security guard
his small spotlight

the graceful bow
the curtain drops



Tenders of the Garden

Roses explode:
a red flowering
beating in the
bloodless garden.

Lightning strobes:
a blue flowing
throbbing in the
pulsing rain.

Secret flesh:
the faint mark
of the hidden
is now exposed.

The rosebush:
rough brushwork
of the forbidden
has materialized.

Roses whisper:
white petals falling
like cold syllables
in the moonlight.

Sightings occur:
black puddles forming
like dark whirlpools
in unblinking eyes.

Taking flight:
the setting moon
over iron spikes,
elaborate metalwork.

Ending night:
the desperate run
through the oaks
of the mockingbird.



Spindrift

The moon is a lure,
sinking in the night.
The waves are a cipher
scrawled upon the tide.
The clouds are a blur,
foaming across the sky.
The wind is a sailor
screaming in the brine.

A line is sent
into the dark.
A man will dredge
amongst the stars.

Down below the silent guest,
hooks begin their search.
Down past the water's flesh,
something stills its birth.
Down beside the haunted wreck,
lines begin their lurch.
Down in the black depths,
something awaits its capture.

The sea whitens
in the moon's grip.
The man is thrown
down its silent throat.



The Beginning of Night

Words are throbbing in the light.
Grinding gears are shaking,
rattling in the wind.
They're humming the lines
the keys are playing
as they chatter
in the cold.

Fog is billowing
as the light changes
and the fool dances
before his mic.

The light shatters
in its strobing,
the bits
falling in the crowd.
In the front row
a zealot rages,
grasping after the damaged
and twisted lights,
while, from the stage,
a laughter sounds
at this ending of days.



Three

Trees rattle
bars of sunlight.
Leaves wriggle
locks of Pinyon Pine.

Leaves twist on the branch
like the turning of keys.

    *    *    *

Autumn bursts like a match
before the glowing of trees,

exhales the
dim smoke of night,
inhales the
last bit of sky.

    *    *    *

Hear the engine's roar
on White or Paper Birch,

penning a tale of roads
in long and lazy curves.



Two

The shattered road blinked
with its broken streelights.

The mouth of traffic opened
as if prepared to scream.

Tears of burning gas.
The traffic went blind.

The road's teeth were broken
trying to chew the black.

    *    *    *

Sunlight vows played
with burning syllables.

Then came the orders
from the screaming blaze.

The sparkling sibilants.
The glowing vowels.

All the fiery words
soon to be extinguished.



Turning Off

Candles wink
at the sight
of the dervishes.

Dust whirls
through the temple
of the night.

Silence sings
down the stairs
of the crucifix.

Winds curl
through the temple
of dead air.

Burnt wicks
from the candles
of the word.

Barren soil
through the ruins
of the sandcastle.

Sharp pitches
up the spine
of the martyr.

White noise
through the ruins
of the sky.



Ex Nihilo

Next to the church
green stalks of light
pierce the darkness of earth.

In the spacious cloth
floats a pale star,
the tiniest of white dots.

His eye is pierced
in its bleeding sight
by a thrusting green spear.

Clawing at cold soil
empty as the sky,
he dives into the void.

Winds play the thornbush
like a distant harp
as the vacant angels should.

A rootless blossom opens,
winks its red eye.
A long winter has ended.



The Patient Sky

Summer's towers turn to sand
with a surge of the patient sky.

Autumnal cities are melting
in the slow assault of rain.

The nights are growing festive
and the winter's flurries deep.

    *    *    *

There is a vacant craft
rotting in the brine.

A storm's white eye blinks
in the depths of a blue grave.

The ghosts are growing restless
as they bob in the distilling seas.

    *    *    *

The green tongue's lash
whips the last of the ice.

The loud voice of spring
resonates in the frozen glade.

The winds are taken to screaming
and to the sowing of seeds.



Passing Through

The night
swings its bat
at an orange sun
and it shatters
into twilight.
Seeds of light
are scattered
across the sky
as the darkness runs.

Behind its mask
a ghost pursues
the night
as the winds
pass through
the dark.

Torn from their husk
the stars fly free,
hurtling through space.

The ghost caresses its new face
and, though by night winds unmoved,
the garb
it wears is unwinding
like the fading of the mist
in the risen sun.



A Quiet Song

The sky waves
its banner,
it whips in the wind,
and light rain
sounds a march
across the damp earth.

With a spark
the storm's rapid fuse
is ablaze.
The daylight explodes
with a crash,
metal contorting
through the sky.

In the haze
twisted wreckage looms
and settles
in a slow collapse.

The storm seems
to give up,
loosen its tight grasp
on the rain
and the light.
The sound of its drums
has run thin.

A white flag
ripples in the sky
and is gone
leaving just the wind
blowing through
the clear blue
with its quiet song.



The Hereafter

The stars are lowering
the day's blue coffin
into the charred horizon.

Falling stars sting
the mourners' black eyes,
blurring their bruised sight.

The priest, in flames,
clutches his burning tome
as the blackened pages moan.

The priest's searing praise
ignites the gathered crowd,
who disperse into the clouds.

In the dark a mime
going through the motions
stops to listen to the crickets

sing in the tittering night,
the stars shake with laughter.
Lights are winking in the hereafter.



The Mapmaker

The shifting terrain
surrendered to the sky
when the sandstorm came.

A vision smoothed
by sandblasted eyes
rises from the dunes.

A page sanded clean,
completely whited-out,
redacted, and bleached.

The storm touches the page,
its hand covering the mouth
of a disintegrating age.

A smudged cipher
in the falling sand.
A muffled dirge
for the promised land.



Taming the Sky

The first blushing
of the jaundiced sky.
The twilight gushing
from the horizon's eye.

A tamed lion's roaring
settles down in the mist
of not morning.

A bright gong's crashing
in a slow diminuendo.
A silence everlasting
in reverberating shadow.

Fingers of rain entering
the mouth of an eclipsed sun
play with the wiring.

There is a restructuring
in the neurons of the dark.
Something is emerging
in the flickering sparks.

A pale hand is rising
inside the house of night.
Stars are aligning.



Corpus

The footsteps of the night
leave stars in their wake.
The blue sky
evaporates.

The horizon's blade takes
the pulse of twilight.
Its mouth agape,
throat dry.

Emptying the parched skies
of the illusion of rain.
The starlight
unchained.

Here lies the body of the sky,
the empty outline of clouds.
Here where the dead pantomime.
Here where the wind is unwound.



The Guest

The antique house
bows to the wind,
murmurs something
as the guest arrives.

The withered yard
dries in the wind,
motions to something
that the guest examines.

The paint falls away,
drifts in the wind,
offers something
the guest reaches for.

The door swings open,
surrenders to the wind,
releases something
as the guest walks in.



Shattered

The bitterns shriek
in a marble frieze
of lowering mist.

The fog crumples,
collapses, and roils
like curling newsprint.

The moorhens writhe
behind the blurry white
curtain of the illegible.

There are peat marks
all across the blank marsh,
vague and untranslatable.

The sewers mouth
the cursive streets.

The exhausted steam.

The vandals white-out
the writhing tongue.

The velvet glove.

The hostage recites
his lines of graffiti.

The kidnapper signs
the ransom in calligraphy.

The clouds are rent
like shredded documents.

The paper rain
litters the parade.

The broken letters
of shattered words.





II



The Beating of Wings

A green vine shatters,
spraying drunken blood
across the witchgrass.

I grab a jagged leaf,
liberate my heart
from its dark crevasse.

The red baptistry
drips with the high art
of this sacrifice.

My heart, finally unstuck,
flutters with freedom
and begins to rise.

All across the stone
it drops its feathers
like a fleeing dove.

Wineglasses are tolling
in a distant bellfry.
The ritual has begun.



Vacant Ground

All language is parched,
and slowly burning hands are
writing with matches.

As the plot blackens,
slowly a thread unravels
in the blind vandal's

blood. Crimson trolleys
clatter, sweeping the lost streets
until they're empty.

Vacant ground: dead seeds
shift, stir, awaken, and burst
in arid splendor.

And now a mad thirst
is trembling in the throat,
singing its one note,

Its voice is cracking.
Broken sound is broadcasting
from shattered playas.



Angle

Grey fog inside my skull.
Shadowy forms writhing there.
Ash falls like a thick scar
sliding from a glowing wound.

His chair moans as he leans.
I hear something collapse
on the other side of a wall.
It has the voice of an oracle.

Cubes clink in his glass
like a ring of steel keys.
Ice drops into the alcohol:
a celestial body disappearing
beyond the horizon of a sea,
dissolving and decomposing
between walls of melted sand.

All of this before
he even opens his mouth.

And all across my flesh:
refrains of bleak truth.



The Dark Fiber

A splash of white wings
ripples the blacktop river
as a scribble of dark water
crosses the stunted pages.

Fingers of black sewage
turn whispering pages
as the storm rocks
in its splashing chair.

The treadstone hisses
its rolling headlines
then suddenly swerves
to pick up the news
with splashing hands.

The paper rips apart
like an exploding star,
shattering under
the undercarriage,
as headlights flicker,

lighting up

the dark fiber

of the night sky.



The Unforgotten

The tomb's mouth
foamed with ancient dust.
The stone's teeth
clenched the unforgotten.

The scribe's pen
pried open the silence.
The quill's feather
brushed the unforgotten.

The ancient dust
rose from the parchment.
The unclean words
whispered the unforgotten.

The deciphered text
touched the reader's ear.
The wordless scribe
received the unforgotten.

The words unwritten,
they rose from the page.
The dead described,
they spoke the unforgotten.

The letters aflame,
they branded the listeners.
The workers tattooed,
they became the unforgotten.



Valet Parking

thin black lines
calligrapher's art
fills the metropolis

syllables jostle
flashing vowels
on pages of night

white suits foam
a sea of valets
on asphalt shores

the tide roaring
seashells washed
into eager hands

the doors opening
an imperial venus
catching the light

the muse is seated
wafting toward her
the scent of poetry

a valet takes the keys
language roars to life
it's time for a joyride



Hunger

Cars are slouching
to the city's jaundiced beat,
to flashing Morse drums.

The sweet rose's sound
accents the wafting tongues
of billboard preachers.

Here at the crossroads,
sour apples tempt the shrunken,
who no longer reach.

The lotus blossom
flickers open on the screen
and it sings of lust.

The sleepwalkers step
into the mouths of their gowns,
mumbling bedtime tales.

Here, where the world ends,
unwounded dragons awake
the devourer.



Ballroom

Her gray beauty strides
across the blue barrens
above the rain.

He serenades the sky.
He wraps his voice
around the rain.

Her black dress rustles
across the dry tiles
above the rain.

He serenades the sky.
He pushes his tongue
inside the rain.

Her blue shoes light
up the gray floor
with rain.

He punctuates the weather.
He stills his breath
before the rain.

Her black steps blow
up the dry sands
with rain.

He punctuates the weather.
He closes his mouth
after the rain.



Drifting Away

Spring's convulsing light
writhes around me,
its lips issuing
a rustling cry.

Summer's drooling tongue
writhes around me,
its violet mouth
full of sap.

Autumn's disappearing sky
spirals around me,
its leaves seduced
by the wind.

Winter's descending stair
spirals around me.
One last visitor
has come home.



III


In the Orchard

The burning of stars flecks
the sky like spilled sugar,
the cold white light
as soft as a blanket.

There is white earth on the grave.

There are white sheets on the bed.

There is white snow in the cornfield.

A dark and tattered tree
sits by a crystalline brook
that laughs over the stones.

Autumn cries with its trees
and shakes in sobbing gusts.

The leaves rustle in the wind
like a sleeper shifting in bed.

Dressed in mourning black
I walk through the orchard
among the heavy gusts of leaves
in November's orange light,
which is like a warm apple cider,
waiting for the apples to bloom,
to blossom out of nothing
like a scream.



Ablaze

The autumn winds dance
in their dress of maize.

Green icebergs drift
on a sea of spring.

Dressed in black
I slide through
the storm of leaves
until its soft
rain subsides
and I find a
little waterfall
rolling across
silver-gray rock
like a moon
directing the
warm waters.

The moon shines
over a black stretch
of forests covered
with lunar snow.

The bark is black
as with a burning
and caked with snow
like white gauze.

Burning in the
autumnal light,
the fields blaze
with Indian corn.



Darkness Waits

A black street curves
through an empty night.
Peaches smolder
their cold light
across the asphalt.

A yellow candle burns
behind the dark pane
of a window.

I put my palm
to the cool glass
then rest my head
as if to sleep
and now I cry
at the brown table
upon which the candle sits.

A candle burns
in a red glass
bloodying a bedroom
with a doleful light.

Night spreads its deep blue
upon the brown horizon.

A black chandelier
quiets its shaking embers.

Darkness waits
in an open door.
The door closes.

An old wooden gate
swings back and forth
in the dying yard.

A pale blue flash of lightning
reveals a child
standing in the middle of the night
clutching a doll.

She has pale skin
and she stares at me
with her black irises.

At that moment
everything ends.



Insensate

A black-streaked gate
raked by the night.
There is a dark cube
like a judge's robe.

Mountain ash trees.
Huddles, whispers.

Slow water trickles
along the dripstone.
Subterranean pools
begin to deepen.

Eyes at the exit.
Slits of light.

A sconce of steel
clings to the wall.
Lime and sulphur
with a crayon fire.

A sudden intersection.
Moments of indecision.

Now the empty crate
of an abandoned room.
A square of light
lifts from the frame.

A wind I can't perceive.
Gossamer curtains move.



Cessation

Blinds like dangling icicles
lighten and enshadow the room.

The window is pancake ice
floating on sky of midnight blue.

A white wash of cold light
sloshes through a black space.

A comet is plummeting,
moving in a dark glissade.

A faint light is shivering
far in the shadowy distance.

A Polaroid sits like glaze ice
in the darkness of my glance.

White pebbles like fallen hail
rest in a square of black cherry.

I shiver with a reminiscence,
with the darkness of memory.

Now tongue and pen are frozen.
Now the screen blackens.



Away, Into, Away

In the chill blue air
a purple flower
peels itself open,
stretching until
its petals fall away.

One of them spirals
through a vast,
roaring emptiness
until it's frozen
in a block of ice.

A naked woman in a blue room,
filled with silence and water,
strides down flooded stairs
into the cold embrace
of a freezing pool,
a small smile floating
to the surface of her face.

In the burning yellow air,
a woman closes her book
and rises to her feet.
She tosses her book
into the pool
as she walks away.
It goes quietly
into the water,
its pages still dry.



Against the Silence

A gold crown rests
on a cushion of night.
A soft whispering
in the dark.

The wind is gentle
in the green leaves
of a murmuring forest.

Coins are falling
in a quiet rain,
soaking velvet.

A man moves through
a faint blue storm,
hard footsteps
on cold asphalt.

A car keeps driving
on through the dark,
lit by dirty yellow light.
The tires' low growl
yelps to a stop.

An empty house,
its cold panels flat
against the silence.
Welcome home.



It's Time

The air is cool and still:
white streaks in blue marble.
Crickets are singing offstage.

A bush waves in greeting
with its dusty green hand
while it whispers something
in your ear.

A coarse path lies before you,
graying into the cold distance.
Your steps are hungry
and they crunch the miles,
with the mouth of the garden open.

A burgundy flower is there,
the thorns daring you
to pick up the glass,
to know the taste
you'll never have.

Sapphire burns in the sky;
sounds like a shattering,
tastes like glass: sweet.

Don't you think it's time
you closed your eyes?



Erosion

The clouds are sighing
and the wind is soaked
in the storm's flat grey.

The rain stumbles,
tripping on salted earth,
collapsing into silt seas.

The waves scribble
on the blank tides
with their blue pen
until the ink runs low.

The ground is erased
in whispering strokes
of grey debris.

The world's
demoralized breath
shuffles by,
carting the land away.



IV


Ghosts

The dark space
The silent space
The empty space

A fusion
A combustion
A star

From nothingness
From the dark

The searing light of myself

    *    *    *

The white pavement
The white bones
The white snow

An unpaved road
An empty track
An untrodden wild

No past here
No ghosts haunt

In the searing light of myself



Parenthetical

—I have never retreated,
I have only advanced.—

(A victorious enemy
marches on my tongue.)

[My own private Vietnam
in every syllable I sing.]

(I taste mud with every tread
and every tastebud they gain.)

[Every breath is occupied
and lies in glowing ruin.]

(Their measured footfalls
grinding teeth in perfect time.)

[I'm burning syllables
in order to save them.]

(I can feel the jagged pang
of enamel beneath their boots.)

[Sibilants are writhing
in a hiss of bullets.]

(They reach my lips' wet halls,
soldiers slipping in the pink.)

[A guttural growls
under a purring tank.]

(I no longer hear the din
of the mouth they maim.)

[Vowels are held down
and made to scream.]

—I have walked so far
only to surrender.—



Red Rock

A ghost flower drips open
like a melting candle.
Harvester ants circle the flame.

A leeward wind tumbles by
like rolling windwitch.
Blue skies circle the brush.

The desert paints its body
with iron oxides and hematite,
moves to the sad melody
of the föhn player.

The atmosphere paints its body
with blue arcs of lightning,
strikes to the loud gong
of the thunderstorm.

Tongues of red sand
burn the writhing earth.

Mouths of pyrocumulus
devour the arcing skies.

A stream of white petals
         to
A shock of blue skies
         to
A stroke of red wind
         to
A shower of black ash
         to
the end of everything



A Great Reward

Leaves of bay laurel
cool my fevered blood.

—a diadem of hawthorn—

Glasses of Chateau Lafite
ring their icy tribute.

—a violent gem of blood—

Words of sparkling praise
drip from wine-dark mouths.

—a shower of broken glass—

Sobs of sanguine weeping
beat their joyful drums.

—a cacophony of fists—

Tears of condensation
weep their beautiful refrain.

—a verse of incoherence—

Autographs of the nameless
scrawl their fevered runes.

—a final broken stanza—



The Difference

Around the exterior
of its coiled body
a hot wind hisses.
The mouth opens onto...

The house of deformity
squats in darkness,
flat, blank, windowless.
The doors open onto...

My quickening blood
a crimson slither
envenomating my heart.
My eyes open onto...

Heavy doors unfold
and sound drips out
of the square wound.
The doors open onto...

A voice intones words
both ancient and foreign,
a voice I'm here to murder.
My fingers open onto...

Into my blank wrists
I carve strange figures
of perfect uniformity.
The doors open onto...

Before me is a face.
Horror is written there
across its reflection.
My mouth opens onto...



Silence

My skull is glass
glowing with the heat
of something below.

You can smell fumes
wafting from the mouth
of this charred beaker.

Lead is boiling inside,
a hot poison waiting
to pour forth.

Syllables splatter across
a smooth, grey workbench
like invisible ink.

A critical temperature
has finally been reached.

Drink the burning contents.
My screams have become gold.



A Gentle Breeze Blows

The words of the wind.
Arranged in meadows.
Blinking weatherglass.

The sign of the wind.
Hammered in the fields.
Bluebells are tolling.

The movement of wind.
Howling in the pasture.
Tongues of lupine.

The swirling of wind.
Circling the prairie.
Funnels of larkspur.

The mouth of the wind.
Devouring the earth.
The jaws of bluestar.

The tongue of the wind.
Hypnotizing the land.
The eyes of the iris.



Shade

Dawn pours kerosene
all over the horizon.

The clock lights
a red match.

Nimbostratus smoke
drifts above the sun.

The air alight
with blue flame.

Sparkling embers drip
from the skin of fire.

The clock tolls
a red alarm.

Contrails roll out,
releasing water vapor.

The air boils
with blue dusk.

The dying flames sigh
in roaring night winds.

The clock covers
its red skin.

The night's smoke rises
and the fire goes blind.

The air obscures
its blue eye.



The Mark

Scribble on the flesh
the words of sacrifice.
It opens like a mouth.
It says nothing.

Stamp upon the page
the mark of ownership.
It curls its tongue.
It eats everything.

Carve into the stone
the sound of chanting.
It opens like a door.
It contains nothing.

Scratch into the wax
the shape of the air.
It closes the window.
It shatters everything.



V


The Room

A grey bird flies
down an echoing tunnel,
enters a cold room.

A white cloud flaps
its burning wings,
flies to the North.

The geese lay claim
to a frozen shore,
sing the arctic wind.

The water's face bends
in whispering waves,
blanches in the cold.

A black ice settles
over silent angelfish.

A humming light burns
in the vacant room.



The Tower

Glass like blowing snow:
the wind is at the gate.

Constellations of cold light
like fingers of melting ice.

Gaping holes of jagged sky:
the wind is at the gate.

The weather's broken view
through fingers of melting ice.

A speaker shivers there:
the wind is at the gate.

He grips the cracking throne
with fingers of melting ice.

The rain tramples the floor:
the grey steps of the sky.

The wind touches the gate
with a hand of melting ice.



Drought

The wind is blowing
through the empty spaces.

The weather is sounding
in the dry hollows.

Only the wind
circling the tower.

Grains of sand rattle
like bleached bones.

Phalanges of wind tremble
like shaking vocal cords.

Only the dead
are out at this hour.

He adjusted the dial
to catch the barren signal.

He cranked the volume
to hear the desert's hymn.

Only the dead
singing with his voice.

The broadcaster was waiting
for water to flood his senses.

The radio tower was groaning
beneath the absent clouds.

Only the wind,
only the white noise.



Flood

The icy world collapses
as it slowly dissolves
and the rain palpitates
with a quickening beat.

Strings of rain are thrumming
in damp chords of crimson mud.

Playing their sad, stormy pieces,
the raindrops scare themselves.

When the key of weather mutates
and the rain tattoos the butte,
the floodlights start dimming
to the darkness of a Locrian mode.

Atop the tower, the static hisses
as the last of the chords resolves.

The dying weather slowly rotates
around the shivering roustabout.
Below, the barrens are brimming
as the hard red land is remade
into the most violent of seas.

The last bit of earth dissolves
as he looks down and hesitates.

He kneels as if in tribute
to a storm of his dreaming,
one that left him a nomad,
one with no more chances.



Open Book

A broken promise of rain
darkens the cracked terrain
with its dry half-light.

A world of withering
crunches underfoot like jaws
grinding in a sleeper's mouth.

The wind will carve with its dirk
as it draws the summoner's rune
where once the storm crooked
the land with its weathering,
when the land's broken pages
were the playground of myth,
when the ink was still black
where the arcane letters ran,
when the book never creaked
as dried pages shattered.



A Prophecy

In this twisted landscape
dying trees are growing
and brown grass chokes
the fertile soil.

The boiling sky is black
and it threatens rain
while a candle of wind
flickers to and fro.

Beyond its blackboard's scope
the sky is erratically drawing
meandering lines with its chalks
across the walls of the castle,
walls that will only fray
once they've been overrun,
bleeding block by block
from a grey wound.

Swinging in the bellfry,
a silent bell is crowing.



Last Storm of the Season

Cold winds are screaming
but the world is still,
untouched, not even trembling.
The waters are tinted windows,
a candle is a yellow crayon.
Everything is solid and hard.

Serrated knives of crystal
lie frozen and unheard
in the hands of a tragedian,
its blue hands scrambling
as the lights are dimming.

At the call of the clarion
the weather slowly dies.
The storm is disassembling
as the world turns hard.

Slowly comes the end of days,
slowly as the winds grow still.

And no clocks are chiming.



The Arsonist

The flames are nodding
in the wind like a field
of flowers. The clouds
are billows of white smoke.

A parade of red uniforms
marches to the music of fire.
The popping of embers
crackles like a snare drum.
The flames a brass section
roaring expressionist sounds.

He slowly dons his smock
and opens the red vial,
grabs the canvas of fire.
He licks the tongue of flame
and from nowhere, a trail—
a scribble—of heat blossoms
with the logic of a dream.

As the words turned florid
and the soul turned to smoke,
he looked at the blank clouds
as words set fire to everything.



Savannah

The savannah is holding
the meadowlark's tongue.
The scattered petals
of silent syllables.

The dawn of blazing stars.

Iron oaks are clutching
their Maltese crosses.
White oaks are raising
their heavy branches.

The meridian of blazing stars.

The prairie is crashing
in waves of switchgrass.
A shower of birdsong
explodes in the sandjacks.

The twilight of blazing stars.

The longleafs are shaking
branches in some harangue.
The voice is drowning.
The conch is sounding.

The night of blazing stars.



Gnomon

black shadows across the dial
white noise across the page
a liar is on the stage

the alleyways of their mouths
black tongues are curling
the black script swirling

black smoke across the sky
white phosphor across the flesh
a spider is in the mesh

the alleyways of their blood
black veins are curling
the black flag unfurling

there are ivory gulls
breaking waves of sound
there is the coming night
tolling bells have struck



Riding the Asphalt

Black tar is melting
         in
Shining cul-de-sacs

High octane is burning
        under
Resonant superchargers

White shoes are tapping
         on
Pulsating gas pedals

    Sanguine light

Air and fuel are flowing
          into
Throbbing steel cylinders

Glycol ether is rushing
        through
Nickel/copper brake lines

Carbon black is shooting
          into
The gusting air currents

    Emerald light

Drops of yellow paint
        in
Pints of dark road

Drifts of carbon fiber
       across
Meters of sharp turns

Shudders of composites
        through
Kilos of shaking chassis

    Sanguine light

Clots of carbon fiber
        across
Veins of black asphalt

Pupils of xenon light
         in
Sunken steel sockets

Breaths of siren sound
       through
Lungs of city streets

    Emerald light



The Dive

He stands there cold and naked,
shivering before the gelid water.
Its dark blue surface staring
at him, looking so uninviting.

What will it be like, the shock
of the ice as it cocoons him?
And what dark things lie below
its surface, slumbering there?

He remembers when the wind cooed
with a cold that wasn't bitter,
with a voice that was reassuring
and whose songs were riveting.

He readies himself with a shake
as hard as his body will allow.
He can feel his blood slither
as his heart works its mayhem.

Maybe the pool will grow whiter,
the decision will be made for him
by the icy whims of the weather.
If he can't dive into the hollow,
bubbly arches of this ice arcade
then he's free from discovering
what's down there quietly waiting
on the other side of the water.

He's probably still standing there...



Transmission

Stormclouds tumble across the sky.
The future is blowing black smoke
into the night's starless canopy.
Its quiet footsteps can be heard
in the distance as it approaches.
The chill you feel is its spies
as they slide invisibly past you.

Inexorably, its steps grow louder
until their roar becomes seismic.
Soon the sound will fully occupy
the atmosphere in quick blanches
of terror at the oncoming horde.

All you can sense is the audio,
the harsh signal you suppose
must be the air gone all askew,
as the thing reaches the border.

Then the wind gone suddenly hard.

And the clouds an empty smock
drifting slow and phantasmic.

Then the rain as it drenches.

And the touch on your shoulder,
the white noise from the stereo.



Healing

Blue: the sum of being.
Blue: this amniotic sea.
Blue: the bird's death song.
Blue: the ocean's kiss.

Wind: the weather's monologue.
Wind: this cold tongue.
Wind: the howling fugue.
Wind: the blue wing.

Tableau: a swimmer explodes.
Tableau: a crowd of waves.
Tableau: a storm cascades.
Tableau: wind-tossed knives.

Wound: a quick inhalation.
Wound: a warm infusion.
Wound: a silent epilogue.
Wound: the torn white flag.



One with Everything

It's been raining for days.
Grey drops are descending
in those huge blurry waves
that indistinguish objects.

Everything is drab wetness,
everything slowly dissolves
into the fall's white noise
and into its senseless cold.

The land swirling in eddies
as the ground is conceding
to a flood that reweaves
all into a new wholeness.

With fear, the steeplejacks
finally resign themselves
to their drowning destinies,
being relentlessly encircled
by the slow, jostling bodies
of their friends serenading
them in rainy crescendos
that fill the damp airwaves
with their malformed objects.

Perched atop their antennas,
they slowly steel themselves
before singing their threnodies,
songs bright and monotonous.



The Longest Moment

Snow white walls everywhere.
The sea breeze of the A/C
crackling like breaking ice.

    A moment of calm settles.
    The pills melt on my tongue.

      *      *      *

Somewhere in a frozen forest.
The deep powder of the snow
blowing through the wild.

    Exhaustion is hunting me.
    Its footfalls in the snow.

      *      *      *

Behind glass, rows of nowhere.
The low security of the store
all too easily circumvented.

    A moment of exhilaration.
    The knife is in my hand.

      *      *      *

Fallen logs are everywhere.
A low gate of western hemlock
that needs to be traversed.

    Strength is stumbling now.
    It scrambles to its feet.

      *      *      *

From nowhere comes the druggist.
The switchblade at his throat
relieving him of his key ring.

    A moment of calm settles.
    The locks melt in my hand.

      *      *      *

Somewhere there's a babbling.
The wet steel of a cold river
cutting through the forest.

    Hesitation pounces on me.
    Resolve falls in the snow.

      *      *      *

The sound of alarms everywhere.
The trembling druggist's hand
fumbling under the counter.

    A moment of hesitation.
    The need is in my veins.

      *      *      *

From nowhere the barking of dogs.
The low shout of the marshalls
echoing through the woodland.

    Desperation fights back.
    It regains its footing.

      *      *      *

Somewhere to the left: movement.
The mad rush of the druggist
sprinting toward the cowboy.

    A moment of panic rises.
    Thought melts in my mind.

      *      *      *

Bone-chilling cold everywhere.
The strong pull of the river
rushing through the depths.

    Resolve is bleeding out.
    It gushes from its wounds.

      *      *      *

From out of nowhere: struggling.
The wrestling of the druggist
reaching for the cowboy's knife.

    A moment of liberation.
    The knife is in my hand.

      *      *      *

From somewhere the other bank.
The slow pull of the cowboy
clawing at the deep snow.

    Strength is staggering now.
    It can barely hold its weight.

      *      *      *

Blood is absolutely everywhere.
The quick work of the knife
opening up the druggist's body.

    A moment of calm settles.
    Adrenaline melts in my veins.

      *      *      *

From nowhere sounds a gunshot.
The dying body of the cowboy
falling in the soft powder.

    Exhaustion has caught me.
    Its jaws around my throat.

      *      *      *

From somewhere: distant sirens.
The desperate rush of the cowboy
raiding the abandoned pharmacy.

    A moment of apprehension.
    The pills are in my hand.

      *      *      *

Blanching faces everywhere.
The last breath of the body
babbling like a cold river.

    A moment of calm settles.
    Eternity melts on my tongue.



A Moral Allegory

Painting with fire
on filthy canvases.
(Scent of dead leaves,
scent of imminent fall.)
Performance art
of the immaculate.

Painting with rust,
oxidizing structures.
(Color of dead leaves,
color of imminent fall.)
Perversion of form
offends the senses.

The crackling verses
engulf the heresy.
(Sound of dead leaves,
sound of imminent fall.)
The crown is burning,
enthroned above art.

Ash in the town square.
Ash in a red fist.



Inconsequential

Blue fingers of wind
caressing the throat.
Inconsequential breeze
strangling the text.

The wind's spiralling hand
bubbling across the page.
Letters boiling like water
in a gentle, cupping palm.

The paper is tumbled
through the quiet sky.

Blue eyes of weather
pouring over the line.
Slow-moving storm system
highlighting the phrase.

The rain's dripping pen
scratching out the text.
The torrent of stanzas
diluting to blank cirrus.

The tiniest cumulonimbi
scatter everything windward.



Vittoria

Beyond the stagelights
the heckler is catcalling.

The white keys wag
their smoking tongues:
a fusillade of notes.

Beyond the stagelights
the heckler is muttering.

Empty mouths open
their gaping abysses:
the wound of an aria.

Beyond the stagelights
the heckler is silent.

The brass fulminates
in explosive crescendos:
the breaking of instruments.

Beyond the stagelights
the heckler is cheering.



Universal Solvent

Into the glass of sky
I pour my tumbling body.
My soul empties with the
sound of ringing glass.

The sloshing atmosphere
bubbles with my screams
as I boil in the heat
of a neon twilight.

My body spirals down
like a clock's hands,
spinning like a drain
when magma pours forth
from my burning mouth.

I transfer my energy
to the fluorescent lights
in a flickering alchemy
as everything goes
suddenly dark.



Ode

Hands of dark matter
Flesh of the void
Stars fill its pores

An empty figure grasps
for the silver scales

Everything scatters

Words roll like marbles
across the alabaster

Blind eyes of the invisible

Strokes of dark geometry
Blade of old starlight
Crimson lines in the dark

A headless figure falls
from a short pedestal

Everything shatters

Words break like billiards
across the black velvet

Closed eyes of the invisible
